# Introduction

## Become a great coach and leader

Key aspect of managing is - helping people grow by providing feedback.

Facts:
- People are supposed to take personal responsibility for their work.
- When we hire correctly, the need to coach and provide feedback is somewhat reduced.
- Hiring processes aren't perfect, and everyone faces setbacks and learning curves.

→ As the leader, you need to step in and provide feedback when needed, to keep people moving forward.

## Busting myths and finding time

### Myths

__Some of the people really don't love the idea of giving feedback__

The key step to overcome this is to stay connected. You need to know enough about how their work is proceeding to know when feedback is needed → stay connected with each employee differently depending on their needs and your time.

__Actions__

- First, try to see them in person more than any other way you communicate (e.g., Face-to-face communication, the telephone, video calls, and texts)
  - Don't check in too often → look for the minimum number of check-ins that will give you the insight you need about their performance without becoming a micromanager.
- Next, plan when to provide the feedback → sometimes speak up quickly in the moment, or pause and run through your comments in your head first. Ideally, prep for a minute. Take a note or two to capture the major bullet points, and then engage.
- Then, nail effective delivery and ensure the recipient really hears you → starts with who should deliver the feedback. This can will be you or a colleague who is better positioned to deliver the feedback and actually be heard. 
  - Consider when to deliver feedback → the best answer is as soon as possible. 
  - Respect where feedback happens → find a private place to show respect. 
  - For the delivering content → remember to give them an amount that won't overwhelm them, and strive to give specific, detailed, supportive and helpful feedback, not overly critical. Critical feedback is sometimes needed, but always err on using a kind and positive perspective.
- Finally, have to follow up to close the loop → can't assume they heard you, agreed, and have begun implementing your thoughts. Instead, go find out. 
  - Follow-up is for staying connected after you've delivered to make sure things are moving along as expected. 

→  This is a process that's easy, practical, and gets results. So, stay connected, plan, deliver, and follow up for providing helpful feedback.
