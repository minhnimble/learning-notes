# Introduction

## The manager's role in delivering employee feedback

Key aspect of managing is - helping people grow by providing feedback.

Facts:
- People are supposed to take personal responsibility for their work.
- When we hire correctly, the need to coach and provide feedback is somewhat reduced.
- Hiring processes aren't perfect, and everyone faces setbacks and learning curves.

→ As the leader, you need to step in and provide feedback when needed, to keep people moving forward.

# 1. Understand the Need for Feedback

## The feedback process

__Some of the people really don't love the idea of giving feedback__

The key step to overcome this is to stay connected. You need to know enough about how their work is proceeding to know when feedback is needed → stay connected with each employee differently depending on their needs and your time.

__Actions__

- First, try to see them in person more than any other way you communicate (e.g., Face-to-face communication, the telephone, video calls, and texts)
  - Don't check in too often → look for the minimum number of check-ins that will give you the insight you need about their performance without becoming a micromanager.
- Next, plan when to provide the feedback → sometimes speak up quickly in the moment, or pause and run through your comments in your head first. Ideally, prep for a minute. Take a note or two to capture the major bullet points, and then engage.
- Then, nail effective delivery and ensure the recipient really hears you → starts with who should deliver the feedback. This can will be you or a colleague who is better positioned to deliver the feedback and actually be heard. 
  - Consider when to deliver feedback → the best answer is as soon as possible. 
  - Respect where feedback happens → find a private place to show respect. 
  - For the delivering content → remember to give them an amount that won't overwhelm them, and strive to give specific, detailed, supportive and helpful feedback, not overly critical. Critical feedback is sometimes needed, but always err on using a kind and positive perspective.
- Finally, have to follow up to close the loop → can't assume they heard you, agreed, and have begun implementing your thoughts. Instead, go find out. 
  - Follow-up is for staying connected after you've delivered to make sure things are moving along as expected. 

→ This is a process that's easy, practical, and gets results. So, stay connected, plan, deliver, and follow up for providing helpful feedback.

## Types of feedback

There are three main types of feedback:
- Standards-based feedback: that's information that lets someone know whether they did or did not meet some standard. It's about the outcome. For example, if you work at a call center, your boss might let you know if you're not completing enough calls. The downside is that standards-based feedback isn't always as helpful as it could be. Telling someone they didn't make their call quota for the week doesn't provide them with anything actionable that might help them improve their performance.
- Informational feedback: this type addresses the skills and behaviors underlying the outcome in question, and also provides actions for improvement. For example, you might say to one of your employees, "Hey, your presentation today was odd. Next time, let's focus on how we're going to address this with the customer next week, okay?".
- Emotional feedback: Acknowledges the person's emotional state but not specific conduct. You asserted your authority, kept it positive, called out the issue about strong emotions. For example "I felt like you were trying to pack in too much information".  

→ Try to be thoughtful about the type of feedback that's needed (e.g., standards-based, informational, or emotional). Some combination of these will get your employee back on track. 

## Characteristics of effective feedback

- First, I want you to remember that all useful feedback is specific, not general. For example, don't say, I think you can run meetings more efficiently; when you really mean, don't let others seize your agenda. Specificity helps them hear you and makes your words actionable. 
- Next, strive to make all feedback descriptive and helpful, not evaluative and punitive. For instance, instead of saying, that meeting was poorly run, wasn't it? You could say, well, that ran long, and we still aren't done. Next time, think about using an agenda and intervening when people get us sidetracked, okay? If you're descriptive and helpful, you've moved past simple evaluation, towards good coaching. 
- Great feedback is also personally owned. That means you acknowledge that you are the source of the feedback, not someone else who isn't present. Never offer feedback and then suggest, that's how the team feels, or that's how the committee feels. No, use I statements and own it. I noticed that, I feel that you must, and so on. Own your words, or they might not respect you or the message. 
- Also, make sure to address issues, not people. Instead of saying, the last time you did this, you left out the variance analysis. You could say, next time, be sure to include the variance analysis, okay? If you want them to hear you, don't talk about them, talk about issues that matter. 
- Next, remember to give people the right amount of feedback at the right time. The right amount will vary for each person, so be thoughtful about how much they can typically handle. 
- For timing, the best answer is as soon as possible. If they are really busy or stressed out, and it can wait, wait. But generally, the sooner, the better. 
- Another great tip is to make your feedback a dialogue instead of just you talking. For example, try leading with a question, like, so, how do you feel the meeting went today? This allows them to open up, which helps you refine your feedback. And don't forget, in a dialogue, your comments are checked, meaning, if needed, you ask if they understood the main points discussed. 
- Finally, don't forget that effective feedback is followed up, not forgotten. Just because you shared words doesn't mean their performance will improve. Follow up at least once or twice to check in and ensure your message sticks.

## Feedback: Role play

For an example of a feedback delivery - imagine your employee has delivered a key presentation to an important internal audience. You felt they performed adequately, but with plenty of room to improve:
"Max, solid job today with the presentation. You nailed the main points. There was only one moment during Q&A that I noticed. If you don't know the answer to a question, don't try to answer it. Just tell the person, it's a good question, you're not sure about the answer, and that you'll follow up after the meeting. Believe it or not, admitting you don't know something in that situation, actually makes them believe in what you're saying even more. Does that all make sense."

→ Typically, your employee will listen effectively and respond productively. But sometimes, they don't, even though you were clear and measured, they might be defensive: 
"Are you kidding me? Yes, I remember, but I didn't think it caused a problem. I've been working crazy hours for them. I knew the answer, I was just struggling to get it out. I'm a great presenter, and that was just one tiny issue. Well, my point is just that - I've been working crazy hours for them. Are you serious?"

Tips for handling this case:
- Pause to let them think for a moment, then continue. 
- Begin by validating the point they've made. 
- Then restate or clarify your point and offer some encouragement.
For example:
"Max, I know how much time you've put in. I also know how clients perceive things. It was clear to me that how you handled the issue caused concern. This was further obvious when the vice president pulled me aside to chat. I like your work, but I need you to take a breath and listen to my feedback because I'm trying to help you. Do we understand each other?"

At this point, your employee is very likely to relax and listen. If however, they continue to escalate, do the following:
- Raise a hand politely, and stop them. 
- The goal is always a dialogue, but when needed, you have to assert yourself to ensure control. 
- Your feedback should be clear, owned, helpful and so on.
- You'll not only keep control, but also your message is delivered and understood. 

# 2. Delivering Feedback

## Observing employee behavior

The art of observing for leaders - based on your understanding of your employees. 

Source:
- supplied by others, but 
- mostly, it comes from your direct observations while interacting with your team. 

Things to observe:
- personality and attitudes. 
- interpersonal skills. 
- technical and business skills, and character. 

Putting all of this into three simple categories:
1. Positive examples: 
  - Development: Fixing a customer problem, improving a work process.
  - Personal: Showing kindness or gratitude, displaying lots of helping behaviors.
  → Are value-added and worthy of a little praise.
2. Negative examples: 
  - Development: Flawed work products, or even work that is acceptable but not as good as you feel it could be, take note. 
  - Personal: Unproductive interpersonal exchanges or personality problems, pay special attention.
  → Address these examples, beginning with good feedback, is important.
3. Good behaviors that we want to see, but are not seeing:
  - Development: Needs certain qualities to advance, they need to know.
  - Personal: Employee who never shows gratitude towards others that they aren't mean but showing gratitude is a blind spot, take note for later feedback.
  → There is no right answer: plan when to spend time observing and interacting, or a naturally-occurring situation driven by the work you're all doing.

Takeaway:
- Give your memory a boost by taking notes regularly.
- Use thoughtful observation to keep you connected with the team through interactions, and makes performance evaluations easier.

## Preparing to deliver feedback effectively

To be most effective in delivering feedback:
- Spend just a little time preparing to deliver feedback.
- Aims for crystal clear communication.
- Find a few minutes alone in a quiet space, and start by simply stating the behavior. 
- Write the feedback down. 
- Ask this question: `What is the action or characteristic that prompted you to want to give the person feedback?`
- Be clear, be brief, and be very specific, no generalizations and no innuendo.
- State your reaction: `Why is it potentially unproductive and worthy of discussion?`
- Be specific about your observation, even if the answer can be offensive (e.g., creating low quality work products, the client is upset, etc.)
- Think about consequences → let people: 
  - know what might happen should the situation not improve → accountability.
  - understand the potential repercussions of their behavior (e.g., a changed role, a note in their personnel file, or some form of mandatory training).
  - have clarity about what might happen. 
- Choose the right time and place to deliver the feedback.
- Approach when people are not too busy and in private to show respect.
- Maximize what people actually hear and how much you actually help. 

Reasons for not planning before sharing feedback:
- Assume knowing exactly what to say.
- Fell too stressed to plan out the thoughts   
- Feel like right now is the very best time to give feedback.

## Handling critical feedback

Takeaway:
- When seeing a questionable behavior over time, or work products that don't meet expectations, talking about and challenging it is essential.
- Focusing on the typical elements of effective feedback:
  - Being very specific.
  - Owning what you say.
  - Addressing issues, not people
  - Having a dialogue as opposed to dictating.
  - Giving the right amount of feedback at the right time and place.
  - Following up to ensure the feedback sticks.
- For more difficult conversations, address just one issue. 
- Focus on delivering one unique, clear, and honest message that your employee will be able to hear and digest.
- The more you learn to effectively deal with critical feedback, the more your teams get used to it → high performing teams.

 Mentioning multiple issues (especially critical ones) disadvantages:
 - Takes more time.
 - Confuse the person.
 - Might leave them feeling overwhelmed.

A wrong technique for giving difficult feedback: 
- The positive sandwich (or the hamburger) method: Ease the pain by sandwiching the negative feedback between two bits of positive feedback, e.g., tell something good that you like, then discuss the difficult the feedback, and then end by sharing one more bit of affirming feedback. Here are some disadvantages:
  - The critical point you really want to make becomes lost and fuzzy (creating unintentional ambiguity).
  - The average employees can see right through it and label these feedback as insincere and lacking in integrity.
  - Lead to hurting your reputation and your rapport with the team. 

## Managing negative feedback interaction

Tips for successfully managing a feedback interaction:

### Dos:

- Remember what the feedback process looks like before you engage, e.g., choosing a time and place to meet, telling them you wish to share some feedback when meet.
- State the behavior, the unproductive impact you observed, and some thoughts about the potential consequences should the behavior not change.
- Resist interruptions that if they interrupt, politely hold up your hand, tell them you will hear them out, but first you need to finish.
- Then, listen for a minute or two and focus on the basics of effective listening, e.g., face the person, look them in the eyes, be relaxed and focused only on them.
- Really try to understand what they're saying.
- Offer a very concise summary to show you're listening and understand when they're done.
- For mildly elevated emotions: Take a deep breath, remain calm, make a mental note and move on.
- For strong negative emotions: Pause, sit quietly for a moment and say nothing (a few seconds) → creating spaces will usually help realize what they've done, and calms them down.
- For a second strong outburst: Tell them you did not intend to upset them and redirect them back to the issue and then continue.
- If it persists the third time: Clearly state that their reaction is not appropriate and ask for it to stop. Acknowledge their frustration, but be clear that the outburst will now end.
- If they don't calm down: Ask them to return to work and try a conversation later, or speak to human resources about your options.

### Donts:

- Don't interrupt unless they say something a little outrageous.
- Don't prematurely judging them and forming a response while they're still talking.
- Never respond to strong emotions with strong emotions.
- Don't react for mildly elevated emotions.

Reasons sometimes people won't like the feedback you're giving:
- Someone might suggest you don't understand the issue.
- They might blame others.
- They might make exaggerated excuses about their circumstances or their resources.

## Understanding common challenges of delivering feedback

1. Deals with the leadership team. 
  - Is leadership asking for a better feedback culture and embracing it themselves? 
  - Are they modeling the way? 

How to deal feedback-related challenge that your team hears the message but does not believe leadership is genuinely embracing the behavior:
- Don't expect the team to embrace feedback.
- Realize that you have control over your team, but not over the larger system.
- Bring the team together and tell them you're aware of the disconnect that sometimes happens between what leaders say and do.
- Tell them that this is not an excuse for the team to ignore what they need to do. 
- Let them know you believe in feedback, you expect to receive it from them, and you expect to see it as a norm within the group. 

How to deal feedback-related challenge that concerns with the past: 
- Take a step back and own the past that led to the current situation. Then look to the future → If you want to move forward, you have to confront the past because it's the very thing you're trying to move beyond. 
- Openly talk about the mistakes of the past, why they existed, and why they're no longer acceptable. 
- Go further and take responsibility for the past, and even share an example or two including them that demonstrates the need to move forward. 

How to deal feedback-related challenge that concerns with confidentiality:
- Build trust among team members by actually keeping things in confidence → leads to strong trust, more genuine conversations, and more effective feedback.

# Conclusion

## Next steps

- The first step is to get feedback on yourself.
  - Talk to your boss, your coach or your mentor. 
  - Use open ended questions, don't ask them how good you are in terms of giving feedback. Instead, try a few pointed questions like:
    - What's the one thing I can do differently to improve the feedback I give people? 
    - Do you think I give too much or too little feedback? 
    - Interpersonally, how would you describe my style? 
  - Gather the team and tell them you'd like to take a step forward with the use of feedback. 
  - Admit, maybe even joke about whatever feedback related shortcomings in the past. 
  - Tell them you want to honestly embrace the feedback idea. 
  - Have a discussion about new behavioral norms surrounding feedback.
  - Don't wait to deliver feedback if you don't have to and speak face to face whenever possible. 
  - Candor is more important than civility in workplaces.
  - As a team, come up with a good handful, then capture them, distribute them to everyone and start using them. 
  - Early tensions will soon become comfortable and normal if you'll speak up quickly and respectfully when people not adhering to the norms.
