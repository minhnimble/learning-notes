# Introduction

## Become a great coach and leader

According to Gallup, only 15% of employees are truly engaged in their work, and the other 85% are just painting by numbers or actively disengaged and looking for the exit sign.

→ Lots of micromanaging and the belief that giving direction and advice and coaching were not the same.

# 1. Overview of Workplace Coaching

## Busting myths and finding time

Leaders' command and control style, and need for speed, is actually responsible for slowing progress and productivity.

### Myths 1 - Coaching is hand-holding

Coaching is not doing the work yourself, or telling people what to do step by step. It's guiding, questioning, prompting, and encouraging forward movement. It's inspiring people to take ownership of their work and their careers. 

### Myths 2 - There is no time for coaching

Give people more autonomy and doing less handholding, which will save time in the long run and increase engagement and results.

### Myths 3 - You'll lose people if you grow them

Growing your talents/team members, you're actually constantly creating value for yourself, for your people, and your company.

### Myths 4 - Career development is the employee's responsibility

It is partially true, but we all need champions and collaborators, people who work with us to unlock our strengths and purposefulness, and help us make use of them for everyone's benefit.

Three things to do with all these myths:
- First, let go of them, then take on coaching your people as an experiment.
- Second, think of two or three people on your team you'd love to help grow.
- Third, open up your calendar and identify where you have two or three 15 minute chunks of time you can block out every week.
→ The goal is to get started with three people, three 15 minute chunks of time as experimenting. 

## Established a coaching relationship

GROW Model (goals, realities, options, and way forward):
- __Goals__: The outcomes your people want to achieve. And as with any goal, you want to be as specific as possible. The questions can be:
  - What would you like to achieve?
  - Where do you want to grow most in your role and/or career?
- __Realities__: What's currently happening in relationship to any goal, and discovering what the challenges and roadblocks are. The questions can be:
  - What are the obstacles in your way of achieving your goal?
- __Options__: The possibilities available to them to make progress toward their goals. The questions can be:
  - What are all the possibilities we can brainstorm for tackling this goal?
- __Way forward__: Choosing the next right steps right steps and add some accountability in the form of timing or a deadline. The questions can be:
  - What are your next steps?

 Step two:
 - Communicate your intention to make your coaching conversations an ongoing practice 
 - Agree on some basic logistics: the day and time you meet, how often, and location → pick a day and time that works for both of you and stick with it.
 - [Confidentiality] To build trust in coaching, your employee's process needs to be held in the vault → the content of your coaching conversations needs to be held in strict confidence.

## Cornerstones of coaching

The __three__ cornerstones of the coaching process for smarter work:
- Be curious → curiosity is an empathetic, open-ended question asking
- Let the employee lead → people often know exactly where things are going off the rails and what it'll take to turn things around.
- Coach the whole person → the life-work work-life merge is not only relevant, but crucial to engagement and satisfaction as we don't always know if someone is dealing with a conflict with a coworker, an ailing parent, or a terrible commute. However, these kinds of circumstances have an impact on their ability to perform.

## Three types of coaching conversations

Coaching conversations with people will be tied to accomplishing goals, both personal and organizational. 

Those conversations will tend to follow a very distinct arc relative to those goals:
- __Vision__: Focus on reviewing your people's accomplishments, to take stock of their strengths and repeating themes, what inspires them, what they want to learn, and how they see their career unfolding.
  - Typically happen at the beginning of the coaching arc.
  - Stay open and keep drilling down into your people's answers to make sure you're not just skimming the surface or moving into the goal setting process too quickly.
  - Spend time in this part of the arc so that the goals your people set are energizing and connected to both their personal aspirations and the needs of your company.
  - A power tip for digging deeper - keep asking the best open ended question ever invented, which is, "And what else?"
- __Implementation__: Translate that self-awareness and visioning into setting goals and accountabilities (solutioning periods).
- __Reflection__: create a pause in the action to anchor learning, growth, and results.
  - Assessing, acknowledging, and maybe even celebrating.
 
 ___Power tip of the day___: Every time you feel yourself about to cut to the chase and give direction, wait __five__ seconds → The payoff for you is conserving your energy and time, and the payoff for your people is autonomy and mastery.
