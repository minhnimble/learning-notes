# Introduction

## Become a great coach and leader

According to Gallup, only 15% of employees are truly engaged in their work, and the other 85% are just painting by numbers or actively disengaged and looking for the exit sign.

→ Lots of micromanaging and the belief that giving direction and advice and coaching were not the same.

# 1. Overview of Workplace Coaching

## Busting myths and finding time

Leaders' command and control style, and need for speed, is actually responsible for slowing progress and productivity.

### Myths 1 - Coaching is hand-holding

Coaching is not doing the work yourself, or telling people what to do step by step. It's guiding, questioning, prompting, and encouraging forward movement. It's inspiring people to take ownership of their work and their careers. 

### Myths 2 - There is no time for coaching

Give people more autonomy and doing less handholding, which will save time in the long run and increase engagement and results.

### Myths 3 - You'll lose people if you grow them

Growing your talents/team members, you're actually constantly creating value for yourself, for your people, and your company.

### Myths 4 - Career development is the employee's responsibility

It is partially true, but we all need champions and collaborators, people who work with us to unlock our strengths and purposefulness, and help us make use of them for everyone's benefit.

Three things to do with all these myths:
- First, let go of them, then take on coaching your people as an experiment.
- Second, think of two or three people on your team you'd love to help grow.
- Third, open up your calendar and identify where you have two or three 15 minute chunks of time you can block out every week.
→ The goal is to get started with three people, three 15 minute chunks of time as experimenting. 

## Established a coaching relationship

GROW Model (goals, realities, options, and way forward):
- __Goals__: The outcomes your people want to achieve. And as with any goal, you want to be as specific as possible. The questions can be:
  - What would you like to achieve?
  - Where do you want to grow most in your role and/or career?
- __Realities__: What's currently happening in relationship to any goal, and discovering what the challenges and roadblocks are. The questions can be:
  - What are the obstacles in your way of achieving your goal?
- __Options__: The possibilities available to them to make progress toward their goals. The questions can be:
  - What are all the possibilities we can brainstorm for tackling this goal?
- __Way forward__: Choosing the next right steps right steps and add some accountability in the form of timing or a deadline. The questions can be:
  - What are your next steps?

 Step two:
 - Communicate your intention to make your coaching conversations an ongoing practice 
 - Agree on some basic logistics: the day and time you meet, how often, and location → pick a day and time that works for both of you and stick with it.
 - [Confidentiality] To build trust in coaching, your employee's process needs to be held in the vault → the content of your coaching conversations needs to be held in strict confidence.

## Cornerstones of coaching

The __three__ cornerstones of the coaching process for smarter work:
- Be curious → curiosity is an empathetic, open-ended question asking
- Let the employee lead → people often know exactly where things are going off the rails and what it'll take to turn things around.
- Coach the whole person → the life-work work-life merge is not only relevant, but crucial to engagement and satisfaction as we don't always know if someone is dealing with a conflict with a coworker, an ailing parent, or a terrible commute. However, these kinds of circumstances have an impact on their ability to perform.

## Three types of coaching conversations

Coaching conversations with people will be tied to accomplishing goals, both personal and organizational. 

Those conversations will tend to follow a very distinct arc relative to those goals:
- __Vision__: Focus on reviewing your people's accomplishments, to take stock of their strengths and repeating themes, what inspires them, what they want to learn, and how they see their career unfolding.
  - Typically happen at the beginning of the coaching arc.
  - Stay open and keep drilling down into your people's answers to make sure you're not just skimming the surface or moving into the goal setting process too quickly.
  - Spend time in this part of the arc so that the goals your people set are energizing and connected to both their personal aspirations and the needs of your company.
  - A power tip for digging deeper - keep asking the best open ended question ever invented, which is, "And what else?"
- __Implementation__: Translate that self-awareness and visioning into setting goals and accountabilities (solutioning periods).
- __Reflection__: create a pause in the action to anchor learning, growth, and results.
  - Assessing, acknowledging, and maybe even celebrating.
 
 ___Power tip of the day___: Every time you feel yourself about to cut to the chase and give direction, wait __five__ seconds → The payoff for you is conserving your energy and time, and the payoff for your people is autonomy and mastery. 


# 2. Building your coaching skills

## Asking powerful questions

Powerful questions are provocative questions:
- Are open ended.
- Begin with who, what, when, where, why, and how? 
- Invite your people to find clarity, self-awareness, options for action, and new perspectives. 
- Act as little triggers to help your people come up with their own ideas and solutions. 

- Not powerful questions (closed-ended, can be answered with a simple yes or no):
  - "Do you like your new office?" 
  - "Are you enjoying your work with Mary?"

- vs. powerful questions:
  - "What do you think about your new office?" 
  - "How are things working with Mary?" 

- Samples questions for starting conversations:
  - "What are your wins and challenges since we last spoke?" 
  - "What would you like to focus on today?" Next, here are 

- A few questions to get at the substance of an issue or a challenge: 
  - "What seems to be the main obstacle?" 
  - "What's stopping you? What do you want?" The next 

- Set of questions are helpful for sourcing new perspectives: 
  - "If the same thing came up again, what do you think you'd do?" 
  - "If we could wipe the slate clean, what would you do? What are possible solutions?" 

- A few questions for planning and action: 
  - "How could you improve the situation?"
  - "What's your game plan? What are your next steps?"
  - "By what date or time will you complete these steps?" 

A power tip to help you turn closed-ended questions into open-ended ones: 
- When you feel you're about to give advice, or offer criticism, pause, then start your sentence with what or how, and improvise your way through the question → It'll relieve you of the burden of constant problem solving and increase your people's self sufficiency and confidence. 

## Becoming an active listener

In our everyday conversations, we're normally: 
- Full of preconceived ideas about what people are saying and what we think people mean and where we think the conversation is headed. 
- Listening for what we want to hear and filtering things through our opinions and biases
- Waiting for a space to interject our perspective. 

Coaching requires a whole different kind of listening: 
- Instead of listening followed by direction giving, listen to find the next right question. 
- You want your people to be able to source themselves for answers, not you. 

__Five__ strategies to improve your listening:
- Be present and focus on the other person → when you're sitting down face to face, your objective is to clear your mind, set aside your own to-do list, and make yourself present and available.
- Minimize distraction by closing your door and turning off ringers and alerts. 
- Give cues that you're listening → Can be done verbally by saying things like, "Aha, mhm" and "Yes," and through body language by nodding and smiling occasionally. 
- Mirror what you hear → Try to understand what's really being said. Saying things like, "What I'm hearing is," or, "It sounds like you're saying" to get clarity. 
- Turn directive statements into powerful open-ended questions → When you feel you're about to give advice, direction, or offer criticism, pause, then start your sentence with what or how, and improvise your way through the question. 

⇒ You're not gathering information so you can offer a solution, but find an open-ended question that helps your people find the best solution. Here is a power tip: 
- Listening and question asking go hand in hand. When you find yourself cutting to the chase and problem solving for your employee, say to yourself, "WAIT" and that stands for, why am I talking? That way, you can redirect yourself, ask an open-ended question, and turn things back over to your people. 

## Challenging your employees for growth

- All of coaching is about challenge, helping people stretch beyond current capacity.
- Challenge is personal, and what may be challenging in a good way for one person might be challenging in a bad way for another, e.g., presenting at an important meeting might be exciting for you and a complete nightmare for the person you're coaching.

Three key aspects to challenges:
- Have to take people to or past their current comfort zone.
- Have to include some brainstorming to find an authentic, relevant challenge. 
- Have to be accepted for it to be a true challenge. 

Examples:
_Employee:_ I just got my life organized and now you're asking me to take on more.
_Q:_ Sounds like you're in between, why me, and, what can I let go of? What's the choice here? 
_Q:_ These workflow changes you have been making could be used to improve our numbers immensely. So what do you think you can delegate more, you know, so you can teach what you've learned and get things implemented? 
⇒ So challenging your employees can be challenging, but if you keep bringing their personal goals front and center and hold them to their highest aspirations, people will find their way. 

## Taking the next steps and building momentum

If your employee is a little foggy about a solution, and not sure what action to take → Brainstorming can help them uncover multiple solutions, and possibilities for action. 

Before people can unlock their creativity, and brainstorm effectively, they have to be able to out gas about what's frustrating them or what their fears are about a project or a task → Do a little pre-brainstorming by asking three questions: 
- "What are you frustrated about?" 
- "What do you want?" 
- "What are your aspirations?" 

For example:
- A frustration: "I can't get engineering, and marketing to collaborate."
- The want: a collaboration that took into account everyone's needs.
- The big picture vision or aspiration: To integrate engineering, and marketing to satisfy the needs of the clients, and increase retention and profits.

Focus on two kinds of powerful questions you can use to help people get unstuck: 
- __Generators__ questions: Unleash as many ideas as possible, and they sound like this:
  - "What have you tried already?"
  - "What part of the problem have you not explored?"
  - "What needs to be happening that isn't happening now?"
  - "What would it look like if everything was exactly as you envision?"
  - "What's another option? And what else?" 

- __Deciders__ questions: Help people find right actions and they sound like so:
  - "What's the smallest or easiest step you could take right now?"
  - "What action could you take that would light a fire under this project?"
  - "And what action would give you the biggest leap in learning?" 
  - "What one action would trigger all the rest?" 

Here is a power tip: 
- Hold up your end of the bargain, and walk the talk to keep trust and commitment high → What your employees choose as a next ride action might involve gaining access to people or resources, or even training. Things you'll likely have a hand in orchestrating or at least approving → brainstorm with your people to discover possible solutions and actions, and remember, to let them take the lead. 

## Managing accountability

Coaching would not be coaching without accountability. 
Accountability involves three elements: 
- What action is your employee agreeing to? 
- When will they do it? 
- How will you know they accomplish it? 

Learning opportunities:
- In-between making an agreement
- Taking action by a defined timeline.
- Communicating the results of those actions.

Small actions and agreements are simple or transactional: 
- Like scheduling a meeting → Reporting back about the results. 

Long-tail agreements which involve more complex details:
- Like organizing a workshop or a training → Guide your people to establish accountability milestones, and encourage them to define how and when they'll communicate their progress. 

Failure is a part of the process: Missed deadlines, botched actions, procrastination, forgetfulness → it's another opportunity for growth → this means support your employee, don't belittle their missteps. 

For example:
_Employee:_ Everyone feels my new workflow system is going to break down like everything else we tried.
_Q:_ Ask your team "Hey, what's your solution? If my solution won't work, what will?". What if the team comes up with a better plan than your original proposal?
_Employee:_ Sounds good, I'm all for it. 
_Q:_ What kind of accountability can we set up to call this down?
_Employee:_ Well, we're meeting next week so I should expect a plan by the end of the month.

Small tips:
- Don't add fuel to the fire when the employee starts out by complaining.
- Holding people to their big picture goals and outcomes.
- Guide the employee toward accountability by asking for a deadline and deliverables.
- Helping them find their way back when things get a little bit messy.

## Giving future-focused feedback

Often performance feedback tends to focus on what went wrong and how things should have been done → it's focused on the past, like: 
- "You should have given me a heads up," 
- "If it were me, I would've done X, Y, and Z," 
- "You really screwed things up and we're way behind deadline, and now it's on me to clean everything up." 

Cons:
- People experience constructive criticism as shaming, and when people feel shamed and judge → it not only slows momentum, it feeds disengagement . 
- When we highlight how people went wrong → it builds defensiveness, because it puts the spotlight on mistakes and shortcomings. 

Future-focused feedback side-steps this personal critique in favor of teasing out what's possible and what might be improved in the future:
- Ask "What happened?" → Gives you an opportunity to gather information, while also allowing your employee to tell their story and vent a little.
- Explored possibilities and identified some solutions.
- Schedule time for reflection and ask a couple of more questions, e.g., "What can we do in the future to make sure we don't find ourselves here again?", "let's really dig in and explore lessons learned from the whole experience"

Here is a power tip:
- Once learned what the problem is, take a few minutes to cool down and gather your thoughts. A little pause will help you put your coaching hat back on.

⇒ We can't change the past, but we can influence the future.
