# Introduction

## Become a great coach and leader

According to Gallup, only 15% of employees are truly engaged in their work, and the other 85% are just painting by numbers or actively disengaged and looking for the exit sign.

→ Lots of micromanaging and the belief that giving direction and advice and coaching were not the same.

# 1. Overview of Workplace Coaching

## Busting myths and finding time

Leaders' command and control style, and need for speed, is actually responsible for slowing progress and productivity.

### Myths 1 - Coaching is hand-holding

Coaching is not doing the work yourself, or telling people what to do step by step. It's guiding, questioning, prompting, and encouraging forward movement. It's inspiring people to take ownership of their work and their careers. 

### Myths 2 - There is no time for coaching

Give people more autonomy and doing less handholding, which will save time in the long run and increase engagement and results.

### Myths 3 - You'll lose people if you grow them

Growing your talents/team members, you're actually constantly creating value for yourself, for your people, and your company.

### Myths 4 - Career development is the employee's responsibility

It is partially true, but we all need champions and collaborators, people who work with us to unlock our strengths and purposefulness, and help us make use of them for everyone's benefit.

Three things to do with all these myths:
- First, let go of them, then take on coaching your people as an experiment.
- Second, think of two or three people on your team you'd love to help grow.
- Third, open up your calendar and identify where you have two or three 15 minute chunks of time you can block out every week.
→ The goal is to get started with three people, three 15 minute chunks of time as experimenting.
