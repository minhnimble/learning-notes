# Mentoring

This page includes information regarding the roles and responsibilities of both Mentors and Mentees as well as tips for developing a successful Mentoring relationship.

## Mentees

Be prepared to invest time in their own employee development.

### Step 1: Evaluate yourself

- Identify your strengths
- Identify your weaknesses
- Reach out to team members and gather feedback regarding what your team members think are your strengths and weakness
- Review previous performance reviews or 360 results
- Reach out to your management and ask for feedback
- Identify future roles you might be interested in
  - For those roles, identify the skills required that you don't currently possess

→ Decide whether you want to improve upon your strengths, weaknesses or both.

### Step 2: Document your goals

- Create a list of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goals.

- Create short term goals that can be achieved within a __two__ to __three__ month period  If the identified goals will take longer, reduce the scope of the goals.

- Take an MVC approach to make quick and impactful changes → this MVC is now your short term plan that will be used as a guide for your Mentor / Mentee relationship.

### Step 3: Execute Your Plan

- Your Mentor begins getting more involved.

- You are the DRI for preparing the Bi-Weekly Meeting Agenda.

- Your Mentor will support in identifying actions for you to take to meet your SMART goals.

- During bi-weekly mentoring sessions the two of you will discuss the best actions (specific and measurable) for you to take to support your plan.

### Step 4: Measure and Review

- During the bi-weekly mentoring sessions, the Mentor will continue supporting the Mentee by assisting with identifying metrics for your SMART Goals.

- Discussions regarding the outcomes and results will also occur.

- The Mentor will continue to review the Mentees progress and share experiences and provide anecdotes as the Mentee progresses.

## Mentors

- Serve as tour guides for the Mentee on their Employee Development journey.

- Share their own experiences and provide suggestions and activities that will support the Mentee in meeting their goals.

- Meet bi-weekly for 30 minutes to work with the Mentee giving them advice and consultation to help the Mentee meet their SMART Goals.

## Communication

- The frequency and method of communication should be agreed upon by both the Mentor and Mentee (Google Documents recommended).

- Communication methods need be persistent and be referred to after the mentoring session or mentoring relationship has ended.

- Texting, Slack and email are also very useful for planning logistics or for having informal conversations.

## Meeting Agenda

- The DRI for all Meeting Agendas should be the Mentee.

- The Mentee should pre-populate the agenda with as much information as possible.

- Mentors have a very limited amount of time to devote to this relationship.
