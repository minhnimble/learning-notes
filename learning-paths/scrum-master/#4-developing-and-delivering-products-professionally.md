### Getting to Done: Balancing Emergence and Delivery

3 Challenges Balancing Emergence and Delivery:

#### 1 - New work is being assigned to the Development Team

Nobody should be adding work to the Sprint Backlog except the DT.

Ideas for handling emerging priorities not in line with the Sprint Goal:
- A Scrum Master protects the Scrum Team from outside distractions by teaching them the rules of Scrum → helping them understand their accountability and what decisions they own. 
- Team members hold each other accountable → having support from entire team to question and say "not now" is helpful.
- DT and the PO should negotiate → Sprint Goal should not be changed during the Sprint.

#### 2 - Poor Product Backlog refinement causes the "what" to grow during the Sprint

- Consider having the full Scrum Team participate in Product Backlog refinement.
- May choose to make this more formal with a [Definition of Ready](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-definition-of-ready/) - clear, feasible, and testable.
- A Scrum Master coaches the PO on how to best fulfill their role and responsibilities to the team with some [great questions](https://blog.scrum.org/10-product-owner-questions/).

#### 3 - Not discussing the "how" during Sprint Planning.

- A Scrum Master should reinforce the purpose of Sprint Planning.
- A Scrum Master can help the team more effectively use the time-box → use open questions to draw out this part of the discussion.
  - "This is a large item. How can we break this down into smaller pieces the team can tackle together?"
  - "Do we have everything we need as a team to meet our Definition of Done and achieve the Sprint Goal?"
  - "What dependencies will drive how we deliver on the Sprint Goal?"
- Break the Product Backlog Items into tasks or to-dos → offer the team the option to take what they have visually captured and break down the PBIs into tasks on the Scrum Board.
