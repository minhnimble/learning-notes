# Getting Started 

Add pub dependencies on the command line. For easy state management, add [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider):

```bash
$ flutter pub add provider
```

For self-driving testing of Flutter code on devices and emulators, add [integration_test](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/packages/integration_test):

```bash
$ flutter pub add --dev --sdk=flutter integration_test
```

For an advanced API to test Flutter applications that run on real devices and emulators, add [flutter_driver](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_driver/flutter_driver-library.html):

```bash
$ flutter pub add --dev --sdk=flutter flutter_driver
```

For general test tooling, add [test](https://pub.dev/packages/test):

```bash
$ flutter pub add --dev test
```

For handling app navigation, add [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router):

```bash
$ flutter pub add go_router
```
