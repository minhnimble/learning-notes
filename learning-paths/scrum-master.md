# Understanding and Applying Scrum

## Empiricism

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

#### Principles

Twelve principles that we should follow:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. → Kinda generic and ambiguous here ⚠️
10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. → Kinda generic and ambiguous here ⚠️
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. → We achieve this with retrospectives ✅

#### The Independent Signatories

while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more:
   
- __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools.
- __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation.
- __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation.
- __Responding to change__ over following a plan.

### The Three Pillars of Empiricism

__Empiricism__ means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner → Progress is based on observations of reality, not fictitious plans.

The three pillars of empiricism are as follows:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 11 26 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/200738828-eb0f12a0-43d2-41dc-8363-7e5998b83149.png)

- __Transparency__: Is about presenting the facts as is → All people involved such as the customer, the CEO, individual contributors. They are transparent in their day-to-day dealings with others and all trust each other. No one has any hidden agenda.

- __Inspection__: Is an inspection by everyone on the Scrum Team. Some popular inspections fields: the product, processes, people aspects, practices, and continuous improvements → For example, the team openly and transparently shows the product at the end of each Sprint to the customer in order to gather valuable feedback. If the customer changes the requirements during inspection, the team does not complain but rather adapts by using this as an opportunity to collaborate with the customer to clarify the requirements and test out the new hypothesis.

- __Adaptation__: Is about continuous improvement, the ability to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone must ask this question regularly: `Are we better off than yesterday?` → For example, for profit-based organizations, the value is represented in terms of profit that can be acquired via faster time to market, increased return on investment through value-based delivery, reduced total cost of ownership through enhanced software quality, and improved customer and employee satisfaction.

Scrum adheres to the underlying Agile principles of iterative, value-based incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing change.

### Empiricism is an Essential Element of Scrum

Thermostat → is an empirical device that it detects (inspects) the current temperature whether it is lower or higher than the set temperature, then it calls for the air conditioning to adjust (adapt) the current temperature to the set one, or do nothing if the current temperature is already matched with the set one. The inspection will happen again shortly.

⇒ Three things to have for making __Empiricism__ work properly:
- The Goal has to be clear.
- Inspect and adapt frequently enough → Shorter sprints is prefered than longer sprints.
- Transparency → Understand correctly what is being inspected and adapted to.

### An Introductory to Scrum: Empiricism

An overview of empiricism:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 16 55 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/200799365-a12a7306-bf30-43fc-a21b-4fc1c122e941.png)

- The scrum team exercises the empirical feedback loop through the usage of scrum events.
- Transparent enables inspection.
- Inspect as frequent as possible to identify variances.
- Inspection enables adaptation.
- The adaptation must happen as soon as possible.

### Transparency In the Trenches

#### What is Transparency?

In order to inspect things in scrum in order to make the adaptations we need to optimize the outcome of our work and the value of the product we work on effectively, the things that you do inspect has to be done transparently.

Questions that can help understand transparency:
- What are we looking at?
- What is going on?
- What is **REALLY** happening?

For example: Raise these questions about a challenge or opportunity that are surfaced in a scrum retrospective.

Transparency implies openness, communication, and accountability → easy for others to see what actions are performed.

This can be performed at the organization culture that people feel safe and trusted to share openly and honestly → Nimble has this ✅

Transparency is actually challenging to achieve. For example:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 17 19 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/200804745-713bb93a-b525-4183-97f0-868f965ad16f.png)

#### Case Study from the Trenches

A software-development company that setup all the teams and have all the tools needed and they still failed to deliver software to the market.

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 17 23 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/201023951-031f1f56-76c8-4a0a-a6f1-c235db0aee96.png)

To analysize the situation, here were a few points discussed:
- "The mute button" creates a lot of tensions in distributed group discussions - when the project manager was asking questions, there was nothing in return.
- The scrum teams say nothing in public chat rooms (the organization), they create their own private chat rooms (the trenches) and discuss things there (confidentially) → The scrum teams use public methods doesn't feel safe to provide transparency there.
- The scrum master go into retrospective and rank each developer based on their story points delivered to help everyone understand individual performance and how to improve. The scrum master shared what everyone body should do to improve → it actually creates a challenging environment and mostly nobody say anything.

→ To solve this, we need to:
- Build projects around motivated individuals. 
- Give them the environment and support the need, and trust them to get the job done.
- Creative workers should focus on trust first → interpersonal relationships can only be built when people actually meet each other face to face, meet, and shake hands, go for diner events.
- Professionally craft a healthy working agreement at the very beginning (as early as possible):
  - Job titles, politics, bias thinking, and criticism are left out of the room.
  - Confidentially, practices for obtaining consensus, be respectful of each others, promote openness and honesty are kept in the room.

  ![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 17 50 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/201024163-b01ad3bc-552f-454a-8810-80260aa4a6d2.png)

- The company can offer nice webcams for each members after the face-to-face period of 2 weeks so they can make use of it at to their remote locations.
- Promote face-to-face interactions → respectfully request the remote developers to disable the mute button for a 15 minutes daily scrum → no more mute/camera disable button usage (ideally) + use tools that can support it during discussions (whiteboarding, conference calls, etc.).
- The executive leader can make an emotional and physical pled to gather everyone together and build the trust, even if it shows the vulnerability. For example: we have a true business crisis and urgency that we don't figure out a way to put our heads together to create value for our customers in an aggressive time, we are going out of business. I don't want that to happen, we have such smart people here, we have great idea, we are well-positioned in the market, but I am desperately needs your help and I'm willing to let my own guard down to do what I need to do as a leader to support you all. I am open to re-craft the way we work together.

4 level of trust to be built:
1. Leadership trusting their teams.
2. Team trusting leadership.
3. Team members trusting each other.
4. Trust yourself.

A sample of a correct retrospective:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 18 20 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/200817190-9a25d7f6-7922-449d-96ac-70a6778d5181.png)

1. Safety check: A questionnaire (5 levels) on how open you are willing to share openly in the retrospective (anonymously).
2. Storm the timeline of the sprint: can be done and updated frequently on the sprint timeline board with sticky notes on ideas (anonymously).
3. Promote anonymously transparency → Overtime, people will start getting more comfortable to share whose ideas are on the board.

#### Summary

- Promote transparency.
- Healthy transparency requires environment people feel safe.
- 4 level of trusts.
- Proximity → the value of face-to-face for people interpersonal relationships and building trusts.

#### QA

Some more good advice:
- Keep things confidentially until the group decides to change that level.
- Discuss and point the finger at the problem/issue/idea, not at the person/personality to remove the blaming.
- How to reward trust/transparency: 
  - Extrinsic motivation → external rewards → not effective for complex and creative work.
  - Intrinsic motivation → the rewards came within himself/herself by doing something for someone else → create a subculture with a small group so the larger organization can see → For example. each person has $10 Starbucks cards → then let's say person A will reward another person B based on the transparency the person B can help the person A to learn and be better at → The peers in the group are rewarding each others.

### So What is Agile Really About?

- Agile is a set of values and principles ([Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/))
- Agile is a way of developing software that reminds us that although computers run the code, it's people who create and maintain it ([The Agile Samurai](http://www.amazon.com/The-Agile-Samurai-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356581/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8)).
- Agile is the courage to be honest enough to admit that building software is complex and it can-t be perfectly planned since requirements change.

These 7 principles describe what Agile is really all about:
1. __Delighting Clients__ - "Focus work on delighting the client"
  - The purpose of work is to delight clients, not merely to produce goods or services or `make money` for shareholders. 
  - The key to an enduring future is to have a customer who is willing to buy goods and services both today and tomorrow. It's not about a transaction: it's about forging a relationship.

2. __Self-Organizing Teams__ - "Do work through self-organizing teams"
  - It's hard for those who have never been on a high performance team to understand just how cool it is.
  - When working together with people who have different interpretations, perspectives, ways of solving problems, we are often able to solve problems that wouldn't be able to solve alone.
  - A complex problem, like discovering ways to delight clients, is best solved by a cognitively diverse group of people that is given responsibility for solving the problem, self-organizes, and works together to solve it. → Kinda generic and board here ⚠️

3. __Client-Driven Iterations__ - "Do work in client-driven iterations"
  - Small client-driven iterations is easy to direct.
  - Through client-driven iterations companies are able to keep inventory and work in process as small as possible and customize their product not only to meet the customer's original perceived needs but also to adjust it to meet any changes in those needs.
  - Client-driven iterations improve productivity for the organization by focusing work on the elements that really add value and eliminating work that doesn't add value or unproductive planning time → This reduces risk by providing management not with unreliable progress reports, but with evidence of whether actual progress is made.

4. __Delivering Value to Clients in Each Iteration__ - "Deliver value to clients in each iteration"
  - Client-driven iterations (and Radical Management) imply a mental revolution, a different way of thinking about work. The key to success is delivering value to clients at the end of each iteration.
  - A small thing delivered sooner can delight more than a big thing delivered later.
  - The primary focus is on performing at a level of quality that delights clients and then provides that sooner.

5. __Radical Transparency__ - "Be totally open about impediments to improvement"
  - The truth will set you free. But first, it will piss you off.
  - Achieving the complex goal of client delight requires total openness about any impediments to the work: everyone levels with everyone else.
  - Radical Management accepts the inevitability of failure and puts arrangements in place to learn rapidly from failure and so progress toward success.

6. __Continuous Self-Improvement__ - "Create a context for continuous self-improvement by the team"
  - Is a deeply rooted set of values and attitudes focused on fixing problems as soon as they occur.
  - Is fragile and therefore needs every day nurturing and attention.
  - Is a top management responsibility.

7. __Interactive Communication__ - "Interactively share stories, questions, conversations"
  - The modern organization cannot be an organization of 'boss' and 'subordinate': it must be organized as a team of associates.
  - Traditional managers speak to employees as employees, and power is the currency of communication.
  - The Radical Manager communicates as one human being to another. Hierarchy is present but in the background.

### Agile is constant change

Adaptation has many synonyms, of which ‘change’ is the most common → After a short time you and your team should reflect on what has happened, and how it affected the performance within the team. Building on the better understanding, the team should decide what they will do to enhance the good things, and remove the bad things – that is you should focus on changing the environment to be better.

Constant Continual Learning:

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 10 28 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/201258413-8561e51e-b731-4986-9082-244772d947f8.png)

Common pitfalls:

1. Try to change too much.
- Limit the number of things that you are going to change. 
- If it is a significant or challenging thing, then only take one action. 
- Talk about this item in each Daily Scrum.

2. Don't see anything to change → There are two extremes for this mindset: being overwhelmed or not seeing any way that the team could work better.
- Focus on a clear vision. 
- If the team have a common goal, then the current state can be compared with that goal, and then find the one change that will give the most benefit for the least effort.

3. The team is changing at a rate faster than the organization can accept → smaller teams (development and Scrum) gain the insight that agility is a continuous process and a mindset (not a state) while organizations and leaders think agile is a silver bullet, that gets invoked and that is all that is required.
- The organization needs to move to the mindset that things will be different, every day, every week → using a framework may help to provides the robustness needed to embed an enduring change.
- Use the phrase `“for our team, we have found …”` to describe your ways of working - regardless of what framework you started out with.

## Scrum Values

### The Scrum Values

There are 5 main values: __Courage__, __Focus__, __Commitment__, __Respect__, and __Openness__.

![ScrumValues-Tabloid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/202380189-6b3c895f-34f5-4e29-b1ff-f9106db8372f.jpg)

### Updates to the Scrum Guide: The 5 Scrum Values Take Center Stage

The focuses are on:
- Why these values are actually really difficult to adopt in most ‘traditional’ organizations, 
- Some very simple, regular practices that can help you and your team use the values for your day-to-day work.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values:
- People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.
- The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
- Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint.
- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
- Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

Examples of misunderstanding the values:
- __Commitment__: Committing to something that you don't understand because you are told to by your boss instead of committing yourself to the team and Sprint Goal.
- __Focus__: Focusing on keeping the customer happy instead of being focused on the Sprint and its goal.
- __Openness__: Telling everyone everything about all your work instead of highlighting when you have challenges and problems that are stopping you from success.
- __Respect__: Thinking you are helping the team by being a hero instead of helping people to learn the things that you are good at and not judging the things that others aren't good at.
- __Courage__: Even after the decision has been made continuing to push back instead of being transparent, but willing to change even if that means accepting that you are wrong, or that your opinion is not the direction that the team is going.

Five ideas for encouraging the values to be transparent and considered in your Scrum Team:
1. Put the values on a wall and have each team member write up how they are going to demonstrate the value in their working day.
2. Add a ‘values moment’ to your retrospective. This gives everyone an opportunity to inspect and adapt on their values.
3. Introduce a ‘values’ prize. Not a serious prize, but a fun prize that sometimes can be delivered to two people or the whole team when a value has been demonstrated and everyone is aware of it.
4. The ‘whoops we dropped the value’ prize provides a way of demonstrating courage, but also highlighting when we missed a value. Of course, this prize could end up being a very negative thing so it should always be delivered in a fun way without negative implications.
5. Getting external managers or stakeholders to demonstrate to the team a value and what it means to them.
