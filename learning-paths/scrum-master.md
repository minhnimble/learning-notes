# Understanding and Applying Scrum

## Empiricism

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

#### Principles

Twelve principles that we should follow:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. → Kinda generic and ambiguous here ⚠️
10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. → Kinda generic and ambiguous here ⚠️
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. → We achieve this with retrospectives ✅

#### The Independent Signatories

while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more:
   
- __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools.
- __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation.
- __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation.
- __Responding to change__ over following a plan.

### The Three Pillars of Empiricism

__Empiricism__ means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner → Progress is based on observations of reality, not fictitious plans.

The three pillars of empiricism are as follows:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 11 26 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/200738828-eb0f12a0-43d2-41dc-8363-7e5998b83149.png)

- __Transparency__: Is about presenting the facts as is → All people involved such as the customer, the CEO, individual contributors. They are transparent in their day-to-day dealings with others and all trust each other. No one has any hidden agenda.

- __Inspection__: Is an inspection by everyone on the Scrum Team. Some popular inspections fields: the product, processes, people aspects, practices, and continuous improvements → For example, the team openly and transparently shows the product at the end of each Sprint to the customer in order to gather valuable feedback. If the customer changes the requirements during inspection, the team does not complain but rather adapts by using this as an opportunity to collaborate with the customer to clarify the requirements and test out the new hypothesis.

- __Adaptation__: Is about continuous improvement, the ability to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone must ask this question regularly: `Are we better off than yesterday?` → For example, for profit-based organizations, the value is represented in terms of profit that can be acquired via faster time to market, increased return on investment through value-based delivery, reduced total cost of ownership through enhanced software quality, and improved customer and employee satisfaction.

Scrum adheres to the underlying Agile principles of iterative, value-based incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing change.

### Empiricism is an Essential Element of Scrum

Thermostat → is an empirical device that it detects (inspects) the current temperature whether it is lower or higher than the set temperature, then it calls for the air conditioning to adjust (adapt) the current temperature to the set one, or do nothing if the current temperature is already matched with the set one. The inspection will happen again shortly.

⇒ Three things to have for making __Empiricism__ work properly:
- The Goal has to be clear.
- Inspect and adapt frequently enough → Shorter sprints is prefered than longer sprints.
- Transparency → Understand correctly what is being inspected and adapted to.

### An Introductory to Scrum: Empiricism

An overview of empiricism:

- The scrum team exercises the empirical feedback loop through the usage of scrum events.
- Transparent enables inspection.
- Inspect as frequent as possible to identify variances.
- Inspection enables adaptation.
- The adaptation must happen as soon as possible.

### Transparency In the Trenches

#### What is Transparency?

In order to inspect things in scrum in order to make the adaptations we need to optimize the outcome of our work and the value of the product we work on effectively, the things that you do inspect has to be done transparently.

Questions that can help understand transparency:
- What are we looking at?
- What is going on?
- What is **REALLY** happening?

For example: Raise these questions about a challenge or opportunity that are surfaced in a scrum retrospective.

Transparency implies openness, communication, and accountability → easy for others to see what actions are performed.

This can be performed at the organization culture that people feel safe and trusted to share openly and honestly → Nimble has this ✅

Transparency is actually challenging to achieve. For example:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 17 19 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/200804745-713bb93a-b525-4183-97f0-868f965ad16f.png)

#### Case Study from the Trenches

A software-development company that setup all the teams and have all the tools needed and they still failed to deliver software to the market.

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 17 23 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/201023951-031f1f56-76c8-4a0a-a6f1-c235db0aee96.png)

To analysize the situation, here were a few points discussed:
- "The mute button" creates a lot of tensions in distributed group discussions - when the project manager was asking questions, there was nothing in return.
- The scrum teams say nothing in public chat rooms (the organization), they create their own private chat rooms (the trenches) and discuss things there (confidentially) → The scrum teams use public methods doesn't feel safe to provide transparency there.
- The scrum master go into retrospective and rank each developer based on their story points delivered to help everyone understand individual performance and how to improve. The scrum master shared what everyone body should do to improve → it actually creates a challenging environment and mostly nobody say anything.

→ To solve this, we need to:
- Build projects around motivated individuals. 
- Give them the environment and support the need, and trust them to get the job done.
- Creative workers should focus on trust first → interpersonal relationships can only be built when people actually meet each other face to face, meet, and shake hands, go for diner events.
- Professionally craft a healthy working agreement at the very beginning (as early as possible):
  - Job titles, politics, bias thinking, and criticism are left out of the room.
  - Confidentially, practices for obtaining consensus, be respectful of each others, promote openness and honesty are kept in the room.

  ![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 17 50 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/201024163-b01ad3bc-552f-454a-8810-80260aa4a6d2.png)

- The company can offer nice webcams for each members after the face-to-face period of 2 weeks so they can make use of it at to their remote locations.
- Promote face-to-face interactions → respectfully request the remote developers to disable the mute button for a 15 minutes daily scrum → no more mute/camera disable button usage (ideally) + use tools that can support it during discussions (whiteboarding, conference calls, etc.).
- The executive leader can make an emotional and physical pled to gather everyone together and build the trust, even if it shows the vulnerability. For example: we have a true business crisis and urgency that we don't figure out a way to put our heads together to create value for our customers in an aggressive time, we are going out of business. I don't want that to happen, we have such smart people here, we have great idea, we are well-positioned in the market, but I am desperately needs your help and I'm willing to let my own guard down to do what I need to do as a leader to support you all. I am open to re-craft the way we work together.

4 level of trust to be built:
1. Leadership trusting their teams.
2. Team trusting leadership.
3. Team members trusting each other.
4. Trust yourself.

A sample of a correct retrospective:

![Screenshot 2022-11-09 at 18 20 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/200817190-9a25d7f6-7922-449d-96ac-70a6778d5181.png)

1. Safety check: A questionnaire (5 levels) on how open you are willing to share openly in the retrospective (anonymously).
2. Storm the timeline of the sprint: can be done and updated frequently on the sprint timeline board with sticky notes on ideas (anonymously).
3. Promote anonymously transparency → Overtime, people will start getting more comfortable to share whose ideas are on the board.

#### Summary

- Promote transparency.
- Healthy transparency requires environment people feel safe.
- 4 level of trusts.
- Proximity → the value of face-to-face for people interpersonal relationships and building trusts.

#### QA

Some more good advice:
- Keep things confidentially until the group decides to change that level.
- Discuss and point the finger at the problem/issue/idea, not at the person/personality to remove the blaming.
- How to reward trust/transparency: 
  - Extrinsic motivation → external rewards → not effective for complex and creative work.
  - Intrinsic motivation → the rewards came within himself/herself by doing something for someone else → create a subculture with a small group so the larger organization can see → For example. each person has $10 Starbucks cards → then let's say person A will reward another person B based on the transparency the person B can help the person A to learn and be better at → The peers in the group are rewarding each others.

### So What is Agile Really About?

- Agile is a set of values and principles ([Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/))
- Agile is a way of developing software that reminds us that although computers run the code, it's people who create and maintain it ([The Agile Samurai](http://www.amazon.com/The-Agile-Samurai-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356581/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8)).
- Agile is the courage to be honest enough to admit that building software is complex and it can-t be perfectly planned since requirements change.

These 7 principles describe what Agile is really all about:
1. __Delighting Clients__ - "Focus work on delighting the client"
  - The purpose of work is to delight clients, not merely to produce goods or services or `make money` for shareholders. 
  - The key to an enduring future is to have a customer who is willing to buy goods and services both today and tomorrow. It's not about a transaction: it's about forging a relationship.

2. __Self-Organizing Teams__ - "Do work through self-organizing teams"
  - It's hard for those who have never been on a high performance team to understand just how cool it is.
  - When working together with people who have different interpretations, perspectives, ways of solving problems, we are often able to solve problems that wouldn't be able to solve alone.
  - A complex problem, like discovering ways to delight clients, is best solved by a cognitively diverse group of people that is given responsibility for solving the problem, self-organizes, and works together to solve it. → Kinda generic and board here ⚠️

3. __Client-Driven Iterations__ - "Do work in client-driven iterations"
  - Small client-driven iterations is easy to direct.
  - Through client-driven iterations companies are able to keep inventory and work in process as small as possible and customize their product not only to meet the customer's original perceived needs but also to adjust it to meet any changes in those needs.
  - Client-driven iterations improve productivity for the organization by focusing work on the elements that really add value and eliminating work that doesn't add value or unproductive planning time → This reduces risk by providing management not with unreliable progress reports, but with evidence of whether actual progress is made.

4. __Delivering Value to Clients in Each Iteration__ - "Deliver value to clients in each iteration"
  - Client-driven iterations (and Radical Management) imply a mental revolution, a different way of thinking about work. The key to success is delivering value to clients at the end of each iteration.
  - A small thing delivered sooner can delight more than a big thing delivered later.
  - The primary focus is on performing at a level of quality that delights clients and then provides that sooner.

5. __Radical Transparency__ - "Be totally open about impediments to improvement"
  - The truth will set you free. But first, it will piss you off.
  - Achieving the complex goal of client delight requires total openness about any impediments to the work: everyone levels with everyone else.
  - Radical Management accepts the inevitability of failure and puts arrangements in place to learn rapidly from failure and so progress toward success.

6. __Continuous Self-Improvement__ - "Create a context for continuous self-improvement by the team"
  - Is a deeply rooted set of values and attitudes focused on fixing problems as soon as they occur.
  - Is fragile and therefore needs every day nurturing and attention.
  - Is a top management responsibility.

7. __Interactive Communication__ - "Interactively share stories, questions, conversations"
  - The modern organization cannot be an organization of 'boss' and 'subordinate': it must be organized as a team of associates.
  - Traditional managers speak to employees as employees, and power is the currency of communication.
  - The Radical Manager communicates as one human being to another. Hierarchy is present but in the background.

### Agile is constant change

Adaptation has many synonyms, of which ‘change’ is the most common → After a short time you and your team should reflect on what has happened, and how it affected the performance within the team. Building on the better understanding, the team should decide what they will do to enhance the good things, and remove the bad things – that is you should focus on changing the environment to be better.

Constant Continual Learning:

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 10 28 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/201258413-8561e51e-b731-4986-9082-244772d947f8.png)

Common pitfalls:

1. Try to change too much.
- Limit the number of things that you are going to change. 
- If it is a significant or challenging thing, then only take one action. 
- Talk about this item in each Daily Scrum.

2. Don't see anything to change → There are two extremes for this mindset: being overwhelmed or not seeing any way that the team could work better.
- Focus on a clear vision. 
- If the team have a common goal, then the current state can be compared with that goal, and then find the one change that will give the most benefit for the least effort.

3. The team is changing at a rate faster than the organization can accept → smaller teams (development and Scrum) gain the insight that agility is a continuous process and a mindset (not a state) while organizations and leaders think agile is a silver bullet, that gets invoked and that is all that is required.
- The organization needs to move to the mindset that things will be different, every day, every week → using a framework may help to provides the robustness needed to embed an enduring change.
- Use the phrase `“for our team, we have found …”` to describe your ways of working - regardless of what framework you started out with.

## Scrum Values

### The Scrum Values

There are 5 main values: __Courage__, __Focus__, __Commitment__, __Respect__, and __Openness__.

![ScrumValues-Tabloid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70877098/202380189-6b3c895f-34f5-4e29-b1ff-f9106db8372f.jpg)

### Updates to the Scrum Guide: The 5 Scrum Values Take Center Stage

The focuses are on:
- Why these values are actually really difficult to adopt in most ‘traditional’ organizations, 
- Some very simple, regular practices that can help you and your team use the values for your day-to-day work.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values:
- People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.
- The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
- Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint.
- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
- Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

Examples of misunderstanding the values:
- __Commitment__: Committing to something that you don't understand because you are told to by your boss instead of committing yourself to the team and Sprint Goal.
- __Focus__: Focusing on keeping the customer happy instead of being focused on the Sprint and its goal.
- __Openness__: Telling everyone everything about all your work instead of highlighting when you have challenges and problems that are stopping you from success.
- __Respect__: Thinking you are helping the team by being a hero instead of helping people to learn the things that you are good at and not judging the things that others aren't good at.
- __Courage__: Even after the decision has been made continuing to push back instead of being transparent, but willing to change even if that means accepting that you are wrong, or that your opinion is not the direction that the team is going.

Five ideas for encouraging the values to be transparent and considered in your Scrum Team:
1. Put the values on a wall and have each team member write up how they are going to demonstrate the value in their working day.
2. Add a ‘values moment’ to your retrospective. This gives everyone an opportunity to inspect and adapt on their values.
3. Introduce a ‘values’ prize. Not a serious prize, but a fun prize that sometimes can be delivered to two people or the whole team when a value has been demonstrated and everyone is aware of it.
4. The ‘whoops we dropped the value’ prize provides a way of demonstrating courage, but also highlighting when we missed a value. Of course, this prize could end up being a very negative thing so it should always be delivered in a fun way without negative implications.
5. Getting external managers or stakeholders to demonstrate to the team a value and what it means to them.

### Intralinks Case Study: Scrum Reboot, This Time with the Values

#### Overview

In their first attempt at attaining agility, Intralinks took a well-intentioned “mechanical” implementation of Scrum - done in good faith and with lots of hard work - but failed to deliver against their goal of greater agility. Their goals are:
- Increase product development scale
- Decrease lead times to delivering business
value
- Improve quality
- Attract talent

→ They took on a “Scrum Reboot” and succeeded by augmenting the mechanics of Scrum with the fundamental idea of inspection and adaptation and the Scrum Values of Courage, Focus, Openness, Respect and Commitment. They made the Scrum Values real by focusing on 7 principles:
- Self-organization
- Team size and composition (7 +/- 2 team size)
- Done means done
- Empowered Product Owners
- Servant-leader Scrum Masters
- Scrum Team ownership for adaption
- The delivery of business value

#### Definition

Scrum is not a methodology. It is a lightweight framework that neither requires nor is necessarily incompatible with other tools, tactics, processes, and methods. This framework (the “easy to learn” part) will not deliver on its
promise unless it is exercised with its core values (the “hard to do” part).

The importance of the Scrum Values:
- “When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone.”
- _Commitment_ - “The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.”
- _Courage_ - "A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint ... This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration." → the team must have the courage to underwhelm, disappoint, or even upset stakeholders (openly and with respect of course).
- _Focus_ - “The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how
progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet its Sprint Goal”.
- _Openness_ - "The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted ... The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren't. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team." → In fact, managers are frequently ill-suited for the Scrum Masters role.
- _Respect_ - "The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog ... For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions." → It takes tremendous
maturity, and requires organizational backing at all levels. 

#### How Intralinks failed

- _Commitment_ - "We don't need no stinking Sprint Retrospective!" → When the team closed out their Sprint Retrospective and headed into Sprint Planning, they were taking on new work in their Sprint Backlog but not committing to improve how they worked due to the pressure to get work done → The value of the Sprint Retrospective was nominal that Inspect and adapt became inspect and complain, and then eventually inspection ceased entirely.
- _Courage_ - "The Sprint Report?" → the team lacked courage so they set up the Sprint Review for success. The Sprint
Review turned into a Sprint Report: here's how much work we did; here's what our burndown looked like; this is how many defects we found and fixed. The team took credit for having worked hard whether or not that hard work generated business value. Stakeholders stopped attending after a while. Remaining participants were managers instead of stakeholders.
- _Focus_ - "Daily Scrum for everybody?" → The team lacking focus on the Daily Scrum. It moved around, it skipped some days. Project and program managers showed up because it was a convenient way to check in on the team's progress. The Scrum Master started to drive the meeting and instead of a half-circle around the Sprint board inspecting the work, it became a half-circle around the Scrum Master with rapid fire status reporting. Team members were engaged for the 45-60 seconds they spoke then they tuned out. Instead of epitomizing focus, the Daily Scrum became a 15-minute distraction.
- _Openness_ - "The Scrum Manager?" → the manager-turned-Scrum-Master took on the new role in good faith, but it resulted in a lack of openness in the team. These upper managers had not had the same exposure to Scrum and still expected the Scrum Masters to manage the work. Put differently, they held the Scrum Masters accountable when the work wasn’t happening the way it was expected to. So even if the Scrum Master was liked by the team and if behind closed doors the Scrum Master was reasonably good at being a servant-leader instead of a manager, the team closed up and put on a good face for the organization. They hid failures and therefore what should have been a self-organizing team lost the opportunity to improve.
- _Respect_ - "The Product Steward?" → The Product Management was - as in many technology driven companies - very much a technical product management organization - responsibility for implementation, but very little business ownership. As a result, the Product Owners were given the title but remained in the service of the product as its steward rather than its owner. When the team came to the ‘Product Steward’ with an issue requiring a decision, he or she retreated into email, meetings, and conversations. More often than not the answer did not come back before the Sprint ended, if it
came back at all. With the ‘Product Steward’ consistently unable to resolve issues in a timely manner, the team in
some cases just stopped bothering to ask. The team perceived the Product Owner not having the respect of the organization, the team similarly lost respect for the Product Owner.

→ The values part is hard. It's not obvious how to get people to behave according to a set of values. The more you push values on someone the more likely they are to reject them. A coach shouting at the team: “commit to inspection and adaptation”; “have the courage to review the Sprint with transparency!”; “use the Daily Scrum to focus on the work in
the Sprint, not your respective statuses!”; “be open about how hard it is to adopt Scrum with your Scrum Master!”;
“respect the authority of the Product Owner even when the CEO barges in!” - is not likely to obtain good results.

#### The Reboot

Focus on Scrum principles - the hypothesis was that successful adherence to the principles would lead to adoption of the values.

The principles sit between the framework (a fairly ‘hard’ set of events, roles, and artifacts) and the values (‘softer’ behavioral attributes). For example, you can easily hold a Sprint Retrospective at the end of a Sprint in the
appropriate time-box, but if the team does not take ownership of adaptation (as opposed to
mere inspection) nothing will ever improve.

- _Self-Organization_ - "The ability for a team to take on work, make a plan to complete the work, and execute that plan. It means that some people (managers) have to stop doing what previously defined them professionally, or that they need to do it as part of a team without the authority that organizational structure would have previously given them" 
→ For Intralinks, this led to a genuine sense of ownership of the work and the team felt that it had the respect of the stakeholders. It evolved from a candy-coated progress report to a mutual commitment (team and stakeholders) to have a conversation about the business value of what was just delivered and what was planned next.

- _Team Size and Composition_ - "Between 3 and 9 people, and consisting of all the skills necessary to do the work required of the team to produce done software." 
→ If team size and/or composition is not right, something has to change. The change may be within the team's control (e.g., skills and training), but it may not (e.g., they need additional team members) in which case they bring the issue as an impediment that the Scrum Master can help remove.

- _Done Means Done_ - "The team takes ownership of a specific Definition of Done and only shows work done in a Sprint
that meets the definition" 
→ For Intralinks, adhering to the principle of done means done meant a change in team composition through self-organization. Previously, separate automation testing, quality assurance, design resources were brought into the team. Defects that were discovered in-Sprint and deferred to a “hardening Sprint” were taken on immediately, and if not fixed by the end of the Sprint the work item was returned to the Product Backlog and not inspected at Sprint Review. Now, by adhering the principle, it reinforced the values of focus (on the Definition of Done), courage (to admit when work was not done), and respect (by refusing to waste stakeholder's time with unfinished work).

- _Empowered Product Ownership_ - "An empowered Product Owner is one who can make decisions about the product. This enables teams to rapidly make decisions instead of having to wait for consensus, democratic decision-making, or the
process to churn out signed off requirements. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee" 
→ For Intralinks, the Product Owner role evolved from Product Steward to Product Owner. Stakeholders learned to respect the Product Owner and the Product Owner developed the courage to take ownership of the product.

- _Scrum Master as the Servant-Leader_ - "The Scrum Master does not manage the team or the work. In fact, the Scrum Master shouldn't even manage the adherence to Scrum. Instead, the Scrum Master observes the team and reacts to deviance from the Scrum framework as an opportunity to ask the team why it's happening. Where the manager's instinct might
be to correct deviation from a goal the moment it occurs, a Scrum Master may choose to see where it goes and give the team an opportunity to self-correct" 
→ For Intralinks, instead of continuing to have “Scrum Manager” role, there was a newly courageous move to train in-the-trenches developers, have them obtain Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification, and then take on the Scrum Master role. When the corresponding managers backed away, stopped managing the work, this demonstrated respect for the team. They served the teams by supporting improvement initiatives proposed by the team, for example addressing team composition changes or pursuing training/learning opportunities.

- _Adaptation Requires Ownership_ - "The team owns the responsibility to improve based on empirical learning. Management may assess team performance and may be required to facilitate adaptation initiatives (e.g., provide budget for training, equipment, or increasing team capacity by adding members to the Development Team), but the team, by virtue of the principle of self-organization, is on the hook for coming up with improvement proposals." 
→ For Intralinks, teams would maintain an explicit improvement backlog and took on at least one improvement backlog item per Sprint. This in turn promoted commitment by the team to improve, and openness by the team to speak constructively about what did not work well in the previous Sprint.

- _Delivering Measurable Business Value_ - "When the backlog is refined and work is taken on in a Sprint Backlog, it must be accompanied by some hypothesis about the value it will deliver. This value must be expressed in a way that is
quantifiably measurable after it is released, and tracking against that metric is required. Delivering measurable business value, is the most important one. However, that does not mean that you should prioritize it over the others but instead, you need to understand that adherence to the other principles combined makes the probability of successfully adhering to this principle much higher" 
→ For Intralinks, this added a new responsibility for the Product Owner. Previously, backlog items were primarily features, and prioritization was primarily a war of opinion, and the Product Owner was on the receiving end. Now, the Product Owner had to justify priorities with hypotheses about net new business, increased adoption, improved positioning against specific competitive offerings, and/or cost savings. The Product Owner was not expected to accurately predict the outcome, but rather to make a case and provide a means by which the actual result could be measured against what had been forecast.

#### Results

For Intralinks, The Scrum Reboot has had successes with some teams and struggles with others. Adoption at the management tier similarly has peaks and troughs. But compared to the first attempt, the renewed effort is resulting in the
expected benefits where real change is occurring:
- What once would have been one large project involving a complete re-implementation of the Intralinks Platform’s UI has gone from a monolithic release plan to a rolling program releasing updates almost monthly.
- Accumulation of technical debt previously deferred to hardening phases has been eliminated.
- Sprint Planning has become the venue for the team and the team alone to take on and plan work to be completed in the Sprint.
- Large “Scrum Team” run by a single “Scrum Manager” was recomposed into two smaller teams (with designers integrated into the team) resulting in lower running costs and greater velocity.
- The teams nominated a “Done Champion” for the first few Sprints and committed to a Definition of Done that evolved from learnings in those Sprints.
- The Product Owner, while not particularly senior in the organization, is the undisputed decision-making unit with respect to the Product Backlog.
- The Scrum Masters (who are also Development Team members) are servant-leaders that are not responsible for managing the
work, and do not have any direct reports on the teams.
- The Sprint Retrospective is held religiously and the teams maintain an improvement backlog that they act on every Sprint. 
- The Sprint Review showcases done software. They are lively conversations with stakeholders, and are a transparent review of the anticipated business value.
- Post-release updates on business value metrics are shared with transparency, usually indicating positive adoption, but occasionally indicating a misfire, and resulting in de-investment where the hypothesis put forward by the Product Owner proved wrong.

→ For Intralinks, the key difference with the Scrum Reboot compared to their first attempt to adopt Scrum was to get to the Scrum Values.

#### What We Learned

Scrum adoption is not only hard at first, it keeps on being hard. If it is easy, things change mostly on the surface but outcomes are the same.
Scrum will simply give you a framework, principles, and values that make the hard work much more likely to result in positive business outcomes.

### Visualizing Scrum Values

The exercise used is to rate yourself of against a list of questions, giving yourself 1 point for each question you agreed with and then mark result on a scale. Once completed you should end up with something like this:

#### Questions Used (Yes/No)

- Courage
  - I work on the next highest priority Product Backlog Item (I do not cherry pick the work I pick up in the Sprint)
  - If I see something that is wrong with what I'm being asked to do, I will say so.
  - I will question & reproach my team members if I feel that they are doing something wrong.
  - Regardless of the person talking, I will correct them if I believe that they are incorrect.
  - I will stand firm if I believe I am right, even if I'm in the minority within the group.

- Commitment
  - I always know what the sprint goal is and how my work supports it.
  - I do everything I can to ensure we achieve the goals of the sprint.
  - In my current team, I have never thought of taking a sick day to avoid going into work.
  - I always arrive on time for the events, my colleagues never have to wait for me to start the event.
  - I know what it means to say that an item is done, i.e. I know the criteria that meets our Definition of Done.

- Focus
  - Whilst working on a story I do not get distracted.
  - If I am not enjoying the work in a story I still give it the attention it needs.
  - When enjoying working on a story I will not over work a story just to prolong it.
  - I do not procrastinate when working on a story.
  - As soon as the story is ready to move into a new state, I will tell my colleagues and either hand it over or ensure that they know it is ready to pick up.

- Openness
  - I do not shy away from telling difficult news to team members and stakeholders
  - I do not hide away difficult issues in the hope that they will sort themselves out.
  - If something / someone is annoying me I will address it / tell them.
  - My colleagues can judge what state of mind I'm in, I can share my feelings with my them.
  - I always say the true state of an item, and do not over/under play it.

- Respect
  - I listen with equal intensity regardless of who is talking.
  - When listening to people I never talk over them.
  - I value everyone's opinion equally.
  - I am never concerned who works on what item in the backlog.
  - I feel that my opinion is respected and that I have an equal say in the team.

#### Next Steps

- Discuss the outliers, talk more freely with each other, and generally felt positive that we were open with each other.
- Look at where people recorded low against some key areas (Respect, Courage and Openness, etc.) then encourage improvements in these areas.

### An Introductory Video Series to Scrum: Scrum Values

Remember:
- The values work hand-in-glove with each other → have __Focus__ but without __Commitment__ is pointless → need __Courage__ to be __Open__ → need __Focus__ to __Commit__ to one sprinkle at a time.
- Focus: 
  - Teams work within the time box of each scrum event.
  - Focus on a single sprint goal per sprint, a single product goal at a time.
- Openness:
  - Everyone are open about work and challenges.
  - Individuals require to show vulnerability.
  - Trust each other to identify impediments as soon as they occur rather than fear of looking less able.
- Commitment:
  - Teams are a cross-functional effective collection of skilled equals → teams commit collectively → nobody commits on their behalf, especially external managers.
  - Team members commit to support to each others and the product, and perform to the best of their abilities.
- Courage:
  - Do right things (not the easiest things).
  - Challenge each others and their organization.
- Respect:
  - All team members respect their colleges and organization → zero hierarchy.
  - Accept that everybody's voice is equal.
