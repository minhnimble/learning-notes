# Introduction

There's the miracle: All those people who said they hate writing and can't write and don't want to write __can__ write and __do want__ to write. In fact, they can't be turned off. Never have so many Americans written so profusely and with so few inhibitions. Which means that it wasn't a __cognitive__ problem after all. It was a __cultural__ problem, rooted in that old bugaboo of American education: __fear__.

→ Writing is talking to someone else on paper. Anybody who can think clearly can write clearly, about any subject at all.

- Good writers know that very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time. For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and reshaping—without the drudgery of retyping. 
- Bad writers became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen.
