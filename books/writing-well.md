# Introduction

There's the miracle: All those people who said they hate writing and can't write and don't want to write __can__ write and __do want__ to write. In fact, they can't be turned off. Never have so many Americans written so profusely and with so few inhibitions. Which means that it wasn't a __cognitive__ problem after all. It was a __cultural__ problem, rooted in that old bugaboo of American education: __fear__.

→ Writing is talking to someone else on paper. Anybody who can think clearly can write clearly, about any subject at all.

- Good writers know that very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time. For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and reshaping—without the drudgery of retyping. 
- Bad writers became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen.

# Principles

## The Transaction

There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you.

Two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: __humanity__ and __warmth__.

Good writing keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next → Achieve the greatest clarity and strength.

## Simplicity

The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.

Here are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence:
- Word that serves no function.
- Long word that could be a short word.
- Adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb.
- Passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what.

Example of bad writing: The president of a university wrote a letter: "You are probably aware that we have been experiencing very considerable potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction on issues only partially related." → it simply meant that the students had been hassling them about different things.

The answer are: 
- Clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing.
- Try to make what has been written tighter, stronger and more precise, eliminating every element that's not doing useful work.
- Writers must constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves.
- Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time.

## Clutter

Fighting clutter is like fighting weeds — the writer is always slightly behind.

Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out of it that shouldn't be there. For example:
- "now" or "today" instead of "at this point in time".
- "up" in "free up" shouldn't be there.
- Take the adjective "personal," as in "a personal friend of mine," "his personal feeling" or "her personal physician." → that personal can be simply identified as "her physician."

Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word that means the same thing, or is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes.

"Experiencing" is one of the ultimate clutters. For example, "Are you experiencing any pain?" is far worst than "Does it hurt?".

Clutter is the language of the Pentagon calling an invasion a "reinforced protective reaction strike" and justifying its vast budgets on the need for "counter-force deterrence". Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.

Beware, then, of the long word that's no better than the short word: 
- "assistance" (help)
- "numerous" (many) 
- "facilitate" (ease)
- "individual" (man or woman)
- "remainder" (rest)
- "initial" (first)
- "implement" (do)
- "sufficient" (enough)
- "attempt" (try)
- "referred to as" (called)
- "with the possible exception of" (except)
- "due to the fact that" (because)
- "he totally lacked the ability to" (he couldn't)
- "until such time as" (until)
- "for the purpose of" (for).

Common examples of a piece of writing that isn't doing useful work:
- The unnecessary preposition appended to a verb ("order up")
- The adverb that carries the same meaning as the verb ("smile happily")
- The adjective that states a known fact ("tall skyscraper")
- The little qualifiers that weaken any sentence they inhabit ("a bit," "sort of") 
- The meaningless phrases ("in a sense,")
- An entire sentence that essentially repeats what the previous sentence said or says something readers don't need to know or can figure out for themselves

→ Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Simplify, simplify.
