# Introduction

There's the miracle: All those people who said they hate writing and can't write and don't want to write __can__ write and __do want__ to write. In fact, they can't be turned off. Never have so many Americans written so profusely and with so few inhibitions. Which means that it wasn't a __cognitive__ problem after all. It was a __cultural__ problem, rooted in that old bugaboo of American education: __fear__.

→ Writing is talking to someone else on paper. Anybody who can think clearly can write clearly, about any subject at all.

- Good writers know that very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time. For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and reshaping—without the drudgery of retyping. 
- Bad writers became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen.

# Principles

## The Transaction

There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you.

Two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: __humanity__ and __warmth__.

Good writing keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next → Achieve the greatest clarity and strength.

## Simplicity

The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.

Here are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence:
- Word that serves no function.
- Long word that could be a short word.
- Adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb.
- Passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what.

Example of bad writing: The president of a university wrote a letter: "You are probably aware that we have been experiencing very considerable potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction on issues only partially related." → it simply meant that the students had been hassling them about different things.

The answer are: 
- Clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing.
- Try to make what has been written tighter, stronger and more precise, eliminating every element that's not doing useful work.
- Writers must constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves.
- Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time.

## Clutter

Fighting clutter is like fighting weeds — the writer is always slightly behind.

Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out of it that shouldn't be there. For example:
- "now" or "today" instead of "at this point in time".
- "up" in "free up" shouldn't be there.
- Take the adjective "personal," as in "a personal friend of mine," "his personal feeling" or "her personal physician." → that personal can be simply identified as "her physician."

Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word that means the same thing, or is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes.

"Experiencing" is one of the ultimate clutters. For example, "Are you experiencing any pain?" is far worst than "Does it hurt?".

Clutter is the language of the Pentagon calling an invasion a "reinforced protective reaction strike" and justifying its vast budgets on the need for "counter-force deterrence". Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.

Beware, then, of the long word that's no better than the short word: 
- "assistance" (help)
- "numerous" (many) 
- "facilitate" (ease)
- "individual" (man or woman)
- "remainder" (rest)
- "initial" (first)
- "implement" (do)
- "sufficient" (enough)
- "attempt" (try)
- "referred to as" (called)
- "with the possible exception of" (except)
- "due to the fact that" (because)
- "he totally lacked the ability to" (he couldn't)
- "until such time as" (until)
- "for the purpose of" (for).

Common examples of a piece of writing that isn't doing useful work:
- The unnecessary preposition appended to a verb ("order up")
- The adverb that carries the same meaning as the verb ("smile happily")
- The adjective that states a known fact ("tall skyscraper")
- The little qualifiers that weaken any sentence they inhabit ("a bit," "sort of") 
- The meaningless phrases ("in a sense,")
- An entire sentence that essentially repeats what the previous sentence said or says something readers don't need to know or can figure out for themselves

→ Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Simplify, simplify.

## Style

Simplicity carried to an extreme might seem to point to a style little more sophisticated than "Dick likes Jane" and "See Spot run".

The point is that you have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up with your style.

Style is organic to the person doing the writing, as much a part of him as his hair, or, if he is bald, his lack of it → Trying to add style is like adding a toupee. At first glance the formerly bald man looks young and even handsome. But at second glance, he doesn't look quite right.

It's amazing how often an editor can throw away the first three or four paragraphs of an article, or even the first few pages, and start with the paragraph where the writer begins to sound like himself or herself. 

The is-a-person-writing check is a sentence that says something like `"I'll never forget the day when I..."` → Writers are at their most natural when they write in the first person. 

There are vast regions of writing where "I" isn't allowed:
- Newspapers don't want "I" in their news stories.
- Many magazines don't want it in their articles.
- Businesses and institutions don't want it in the reports.
- Colleges don't want "I" in their term papers or dissertations.
- English teachers discourage any first-person pronoun except the literary "we".

Sensible reasons for avoiding "I":
- Newspaper articles should consist of news, reported objectively. 
- Teachers who don't want to give students an easy escape into opinion before they have grappled with the discipline of assessing a work on its merits and on external sources. For example: "I think Hamlet was stupid".

Takeaways:
- Must know what the essential tools are and what job they were designed to do.
- Never forget that you are practicing a craft that's based on certain principles.
- If what you build is sturdy and serviceable, take satisfaction in its plain strength.
- A fundamental rule is: be yourself → It requires writers to do two things that by their metabolism are impossible: relax and have confidence.
- To relax effectively, don't try so hard to make an impression, just plunge in.
- Write in the first person when possible: to use "I" and "me" and "we" and "us."
- If it is not allowed to use "I", at least think "I" while you write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the "I"s out → It will warm up your impersonal style.
- Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal.
- Believe in your own identity and your own opinions.
- Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.

## The Audience

"Who am I writing for?" - it s a fundamental question, and it has a fundamental answer: You are writing for yourself.

Donts: 
- Try to visualize the great mass audience → every reader is a different person.
- Try to guess what sort of thing editors want to publish or what you think the country is in a mood to read → they don't know what they want to read until they read it. Besides, they're always looking for something new.
- Worry about whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge a sudden impulse for humor → If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in.

You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.

There are 2 different issues:
- __Craft__, is a question of mastering a precise skill → reader is an impatient bird, perched on the thin edge of distraction or sleep.
- __Attitude__ is a question of how you use that skill to express your personality → write for yourself and not be gnawed by worry over whether the reader is tagging along.

How can you think carefully about not losing readers and still be carefree about their opinion?
- __Craft__:
  - Work hard to master the tools. 
  - Simplify, prune and strive for order.
  - Think of this as a mechanical act, and soon your sentences will become cleaner.

- __Attitude__:
  - Think of this as a creative act: the expressing of who you are.
  - Relax and say what you want to say.
  - Only need to be true to yourself when you write.
  - Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation. → If you're not a person who says "indeed" or "moreover," or who calls someone an individual ("he's a fine individual"), don't write it.

Mencken was never timid or evasive; tie didn't kowtow to the reader or curry anyone's favor. It takes courage to be such a writer, but it is out of such courage that revered and influential journalists are born.

Any writer who uses "ain't" and "tendentious" in the same sentence, who quotes without using quotation marks, knows what he's doing. This seemingly artless style, so full of art, is ideal for Herndon's purpose. It avoids the pretentiousness that infects so much writing by people who are doing worthy work, and it allows for a rich vein of humor and common sense. 

## Words

`Journalese` - a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech:
- Adjectives are used as nouns ("greats", "notables").
- Nouns are used as verbs ("to host"), or they are chopped off to form verbs ("enthuse", "emote"), or they are padded to form verbs ("beef up",  "put teeth into").

→ Its the death of freshness in anybody's style - the common currency of newspapers and of magazines, a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them.

Example of such journalese phrases that only reach the nearest cliché:
- "Shouldered his way" 
- "only to be met" 
- "crashing into his face" 
- "waging a lonely war" 
- "corruption that is rife" 
- "sending shock"
- "New York's finest"
→ We know just what to expect. No surprise awaits us in the form of an unusual word, an oblique look.

### Takeaway
- Develop a respect for words and a curiosity about their shades of meaning that is almost obsessive.
- Take the time to root around and find the ones you want.
- Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what has been written by earlier masters.
- Learn by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing that you wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.
- Get in the habit of using dictionaries.
- Learn about words' etymology and notice what curious branches they original root have put forth.
- Master the small gradations between words that seem to be synonyms. For instances:
  - "cajole", "wheedle", "blandish" and "coax".
  - Look up "villain", since only a lexicographer could conjure back of iniquity, obliquity, depravity, knavery, profligacy, frailty, flagrancy, infamy, immorality, corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding and sin.
  - Nouns: ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, Jezebels and jades.
  - Adjectives: foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical.
- Use dictionary with gratitude → you want to know how synonyms differ first, then go to the dictionary.
- Pay attentions to how words sound when choosing and stringing them together → readers hear what they are reading far more than you realize. For example, E. B. White suggests phrases that has survived for a century:
  - "Times like these try men's souls."
  - "How trying it is to live in these times!"
  - "These are trying times for men's souls."
  - "Soulwise, these are trying times."
- If all your sentences move at the same plodding gait, which even you recognize as deadly but don't know how to cure, read them aloud.
- See if you can gain wordings variety so they don't all sound as if they came out of the same mold by:
  - reversing the order of a sentence.
  - substituting a word that has freshness or oddity.
  - altering the length of your sentences.

## Usage

Good words:
- "Hassle" is both a verb and a noun, meaning to give somebody a hard time, or the act of being given a hard time.
- "Freak" means an enthusiast, and there's no missing the aura of obsession that goes with calling someone a jazz freak, or a chess freak, or a sun freak.

Cheap words:
- "notables" 
- "greats" 
- "upcoming"

Why is one word good and another word cheap? 
→ No concrete answer because:
- sage has no fixed boundaries.
- Language is a fabric that changes from one week to another.
- Word freaks fight over what is allowable, often reaching their decision on a subjective basis such as `taste`.

`The American Heritage Dictionary` - it assembled a "Usage Panel" to help them appraise the new words and dubious constructions that had come knocking at the door.

The laws of usage are relative, bending with the taste of the lawmaker → In the end, it comes down to what is "correct" usage. For example:
- "dropout" - the perfect word.
- "cyberspace," "meltdown," "skyjacker," "wetlands," "software," "fax," "macho," "yuppie," "gentrify" - correct usage every day of science and technology, fad and fashion and social change.
- "trip," "rap," "crash," "trash," "funky," "split," "rip-off," "vibes," "downer," "bummer" - lashing back at the self-important verbiage.
- "can" and "may," "fewer" and "less," "eldest" and "oldest," etc. - most of the classic distinctions in grammar.

Incorrect usage will lose you the readers you would most like to win. Know the difference between:
- a "reference" and an "allusion" 
- "connive" and "conspire" 
- "compare with" and "compare to"
- If you must use "comprise", use it right. It means "include" - `dinner comprises meat, potatoes, salad and dessert`.

One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon. For example:
- "prioritize" is jargon - a pompous new verb that sounds more important than "rank" — and that "bottom line" is usage, a metaphor borrowed from the world of bookkeeping that conveys an image we can picture. As every businessman knows, the bottom line is the one that matters. If someone says, "The bottom line is that we just can't work together," we know what he means. I don't much like the phrase, but the bottom line is that it's here to stay.

New usages also arrive with new political events. For example:
- Vietnam gave us "escalate".
- Watergate gave us a whole lexicon of words connoting obstruction and deceit: "stonewall," "deep-six," "launder," "enemies list" and other "gate"-suffix scandals ("Irangate").
→ It's vivid, and we need it.

A similar guideline for separating good from technical English. For example, the difference between, "printout" and "input":
- A printout is a specific object that a computer emits. Before the advent of computers it wasn't needed; now it is. But it has stayed where it belongs. 
- Not so with "input," which was coined to describe the information that's fed to a computer. Our input is sought on every subject, from diets to philosophical discourse ("I'd like your input on whether God really exists").
→ Good usage consists of using good words if they already exist to express myself clearly and simply to someone else.

# Methods

## Unity

The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis. For example, if you went to work for a newspaper that required you to write two or three articles every day, you would be a better writer after six months.
→ Your style might still be full of clutter and clichés, but you would be exercising your powers of putting the English language on paper, gaining confidence and identifying the most common problems.

All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem, for example:
- a problem of where to obtain the facts or how to organize the material.
- a problem of approach or attitude, tone or style.

→ Unity is the anchor of good writing. It helps keep the reader from straggling off in all directions and satisfies the readers' subconscious need for order and reassures them that all is well at the helm.

- __Unity of pronoun__: Are you going to write in the first person, as a participant, or in the third person, as an observer? Or even in the second person?
- __Unity of tense__: Most people write mainly in the past tense, but some people write agreeably in the present. What is not agreeable is to switch back and forth → you must choose the tense in which you are principally going to address the reader, no matter how many glances you may take backward or forward along the way.
- __Unity of mood__: You might want to talk to the reader in the casual voice, or approach the reader with a certain formality to describe a serious event or to present a set of important facts. But again don't mix them.

Ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: 
- "In what capacity am I going to address the reader?" (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) 
- "What pronoun and tense am I going to use?" 
- "What style?" (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) 
- "What attitude am I going to take toward the mate- rial?" (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) 
- "How much do I want to cover?"
- "What one point do I want to make?"

The last two questions are especially important. What you think is definitive today will turn infinitive by tonight, and writers who doggedly pursue every last fact will find themselves pursuing the rainbow and never settling down to write → Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write. Some tips could be:
- Think small.
- Decide what corner of your subject you're going to bite off, and be content to cover it well and stop.
- Often you'll find that along the way you've managed to say almost everything you wanted to say about the entire subject.
- Decide what single point you want to leave in the reader's mind.

An unwieldy writing task is a drain on your enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is the force that keeps you going and keeps the reader in your grip.

Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn't have before. Not two thoughts, or five—just one. 

The single point will affect your decision about tone and attitude. Some points are best made by earnestness, some by dry understatement, some by humor.

It is normal that the material begins to lead you in an unexpected direction, where you are more comfortable writing in a different tone. Some tips could be: 
- Don't fight such a current if it feels right. 
- Trust your material if it's taking you into terrain you didn't intend to enter but where the vibrations are good.
- Adjust your style accordingly and proceed to whatever destination you reach.
- Don't ever become the prisoner of a preconceived plan.
- If this issue happens, then it's just a matter of making repairs. You can go back to the beginning and rewrite it so that your mood and your style are consistent from start to finish.

## The Lead and the Ending

The most important sentence in any article is the first one → If it doesn't induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead, and it goes on the same for the subsequent sentences. Of such a progression of sentences, a writer constructs that fateful unit, the "lead"

No pat answer for a standard lead's length:
- Some leads hook the reader with just a few well-baited sentences.
- Others amble on for several pages, exerting a slow but steady pull.
- May depend on the audience you're writing for. For example, readers of a literary review expect its writers to start somewhat discursively.

### The Lead

#### Takeaway

- The lead may not be the best of all possible leads, but if it does the job it's supposed to do, be thankful and proceed.
- Capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading by cajole him with freshness, or novelty, or paradox, or humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question. Anything will do, as long as it nudges his curiosity and tugs at his sleeve.
- The lead must do some real work. It must provide hard details that tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read it. But don't dwell on the reason. Coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.
- Continue to build and amplify the paragraph that preceded it. Give more thought to adding solid detail and less to entertaining the reader.
- Take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph, try to give that sentence an extra twist of humor or surprise, like the periodic "snapper" in the routine of a stand-up comic.
- Another approach is to just tell a story. It's such a simple solution, so obvious and unsophisticated. However, it is the oldest and most compelling method of holding someone's attention.
- Always look for ways to convey your information in narrative form.
- Approach their subject in a manner that most naturally suits what they are writing about and who they are.
 
For some writing example of a good lead sentence:
- "I've often wondered what goes into a hot dog. Now I know and I wish I didn't".

A slower lead, luring the reader more with curiosity than with humor:
- By any reasonable standard, nobody would want to look twice—or even once—at the piece of slippery elm bark from Clear Lake, Wisc., birthplace of pitcher Burleigh Grimes, that is on display at the National Baseball Museum and Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. As the label explains, it is the kind of bark Grimes chewed during games "to increase saliva for throwing the spitball. When wet, the ball sailed to the plate in deceptive fashion."
→ Learning points from this lead:
- Salvation often lies not in the writer's style but in some odd fact he or she was able to discover.
- You should always collect more material than you will use but you don't go on gathering facts forever. At some point you must stop researching and start writing.
- Look for your material everywhere, not just by reading the obvious sources and interviewing the obvious people:
  - Look at signs and at billboards and at all the junk written along the American roadside.
  - Read the labels on our packages and the instructions on our toys, the claims on our medicines and the graffiti on our walls.
  - Read the fillers, so rich in self-esteem, that come spilling out of your monthly statement from the electric company and the telephone company and the bank.
  - Read menus and catalogues and second- class mail.
  - Nose about in obscure crannies of the newspaper, like the Sunday real estate section → you can tell the temper of a society by what patio accessories it wants.

Here's the opening sentence of seven memorable nonfiction books:
- "In the beginning God created heaven and earth". `—THE BIBLE`
- "In the summer of the Roman year 699, now described as the year 55 before the birth of Christ, the Proconsul of Gaul, Gaius Julius Caesar, turned his gaze upon Britain". `—WINSTON S. CHURCHILL, A HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES`
- "Put this puzzle together and you will find milk, cheese and eggs, meat, fish, beans and cereals, greens, fruits and root vegetables—foods that contain our essential daily needs". `—IRMA S. ROMBAUER, JOY OF COOKING`
- "To the Manus native the world is a great platter, curving upwards on all sides, from his flat lagoon village where the pile-houses stand like long-legged birds, placid and unstirred by the changing tides". `—MARGARET MEAD, GROWING UP IN NEW GUINEA`
- "The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women". `—BETTY FRIEDAN, THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE`
- "Within five minutes, or ten minutes, no more than that, three of the others had called her on the telephone to ask her if she had heard that something had happened out there". `-TOM WOLFE, THE RIGHT STUFF`
- "You know more than you think you do". `—BENJAMIN SPOCK, BABY AND CHILD CARE`

Bad leads per category e.g. `future archaeologist`:
- "If a creature from Mars landed on our planet he would be amazed to see hordes of scantily clad earthlings lying on the sand barbecuing their skins".
- "One day not long ago a small button-nosed boy was walking with his dog, Terry, in a field outside Paramus, N.J., when he saw something that looked strangely like a balloon rising out of the ground".

### The Ending

- Give as much thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first.
- An article that doesn't stop where it should stop becomes a drag and therefore a failure.
- At any age—even professional writers are adrift more often than they would like to admit. But if you're going to write good nonfiction you must wriggle out of the Ending's dread grip.
- Failure to know where the ending sentence should occur can wreck an article that until its final stage has been tightly constructed.
- The positive reason for ending well is that a good last sentence, or last paragraph, is a joy in itself. It gives the reader a lift, and it lingers when the article is over.
- The perfect ending should take your readers slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right. For example, we are in the middle of a scene (we think), when suddenly one of the actors says something funny, or outrageous, or epigrammatic, and the lights go out. We are startled to find the scene over, and then delighted by the aptness of how it ended.
- When you're ready to stop, stop. If you have presented all the facts and made the point you want to make, look for the nearest exit.
- Often it takes just a few sentences to wrap things up. Ideally they should encapsulate the idea of the piece and conclude with a sentence that jolts us with its fitness or unexpectedness:
  - "We suffer most, not when the White House is a peaceful dormitory, but when it [has] a tin-pot Paul bawling from the roof. Counting out Harding as a cipher only, Dr. Coolidge was preceded by one World Saver and followed by two more. What enlightened American, having to choose between any of them and another Coolidge, would hesitate for an instant? There were no thrills while he reigned, but neither were there any headaches. He had no ideas, and he was not a nuisance".
- Bring the story full circle to strike at the end an echo of a note that was sounded at the beginning.
- What usually works best is a quotation → Go back through your notes to find some remark that has a sense of finality, or that's funny, or that adds an unexpected closing detail.
- Surprise is the most refreshing element in nonfiction writing → If something surprises you it will also surprise, and delight, the people you are writing for, especially as you conclude your story and send them on their way.

## Bits & Pieces

### VERBS.

- Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb → The difference between an active verb style and a passive verb style: "Joe saw him" is strong. "He was seen by Joe" is weak → The first is short and precise; it leaves no doubt about who did what. The second is necessarily longer and it has an insipid quality.
- Active verbs push hard; passive verbs tug fitfully.
- Avoid the kind of verbs that need an appended preposition.
- Be precise. Use precise verbs.

### ADVERBS.

- Most adverbs are unnecessary.
- Don't choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same meaning. For example: 
  - "the radio blared loudly" → "blare" connotes loudness already.
  - "effortlessly easy"
  - "slightly spartan"
  - "totally flabbergasted"
- Retire "decidedly" and all its slippery cousins.

### ADJECTIVES.

- Most adjectives are also unnecessary.
- Don't choose a adjective that the concept is already in the noun. For example, adjectives denoting the color of an object whose color is well known:
  - "yellow daffodils"
  - "brownish dirt"
- Use adjectives that would do a job that the noun alone wouldn't be doing. For example, if you're in a part of the country where the dirt is red, feel free to mention the "red dirt". 
- Make your adjectives do work that needs to be done. For example:
  - "a house was drab"
  - "a girl was beautiful"

### LITTLE QUALIFIERS.

- Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw such as "a bit", "a little", "sort of", "kind of", "rather", "quite", "very", "too", "pretty much", "in a sense", etc. → they dilute your style and your persuasiveness.
- Don't be kind of bold. Be bold.

Good writing is lean and confident. For example:
- Do:
  - Be confused. Be tired. Be depressed. Be annoyed.
  - Happy. Expensive. Awesome. Spectacular. Methodical.
- Don't: 
  - A bit confused. Sort of tired. A little depressed. Somewhat annoyed.
  - Too happy. Pretty expensive. Very awesome. Very spectacular. Very methodical.

### PUNCTUATION.

#### The Period

- There's not much to be said about the period except that most writers don't reach it soon enough.
- There is no minimum length for a sentence that's acceptable.
- If you want to write long sentences, be a genius or at least make sure that the sentence is under control from beginning to end, in syntax and punctuation.

#### The Exclamation Point

- Don't use it unless you must to achieve a certain effect.
- Construct your sentence so that the order of the words will put the emphasis where you want it.
- Resist using an exclamation point to notify the reader that you are making a joke or being ironic.

#### The Semicolon

- In the 19th-century, it is associated with the carefully balanced sentences, the judicious weighing of "on the one hand" and "on the other hand".
- Should be used sparingly by modern writers of nonfiction.
- Use it with discretion as it is no longer popular and rely instead on the period and the dash.

#### The Dash

- The dash is used in two ways: 
  - One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part, for example: "We decided to keep going — it was only 100 miles more and we could get there in time for dinner."
  - The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence, for example: "She told me to get in the car — she had been after me all summer to have a haircut — and we drove silently into town."

#### The Colon

- It has begun to look even more antique than the semicolon, and many of its functions have been taken over by the dash.
- Bring your sentence to a brief halt before you plunge into like an itemized list, for example: "The brochure said the ship would stop at the
following ports: Oran, Algiers, Naples, Brindisi, Piraeus, Istanbul and Beirut."

### MOOD CHANGERS.

- Alert the reader as soon as possible to any change in mood from the previous sentence → At least a dozen words will do this job for you: "but", "yet", "however", "nevertheless", "still", "instead", "thus", "therefore", "meanwhile", "now", "later", "today", "subsequently".
- "But" is the strongest word at the start. "However" is a weaker word and needs careful placement → Don't start a sentence with "however", it hangs there like a wet dishrag. And don't end with "however"  as by that time, it has lost its howeverness.
- "Yet" does almost the same job as "but", though its meaning is closer to "nevertheless" → They can replace a whole long phrase that summarizes what the reader has just been told, for example: "Yet he decided to go" vs "Despite the fact that all these dangers had been pointed out to him, he decided to go."
- "Meanwhile", "now", "today" and "later" can save confusion for careless writers often change their time frame without remembering to tip the reader off. For example:
  - "Now I know better."
  - "Later I found out why."
- Always ask yourself where you left your readers in the previous sentence and make sure they are oriented.

### CONTRACTIONS.

- Contractions like: "I'll" and "won't" and "can't" will help make your style warmer and truer to your personality. For example: "I'll be glad to see them if they don't get mad" vs "I will be glad to see them if they do not get mad." → Read that aloud and hear how stilted it sounds.
- No concrete rule on contraction usage, just trust your ear and your instincts.
- Just avoid one form — "I'd", "he'd", "we'd", etc. — because "I'd" can mean both "I had" and "I would".
- Don't invent contractions like "could've" as they cheapen your style → Stick with the ones you can find in the dictionary.

### THAT AND WHICH.

#### That

- Always use "that" unless it makes your meaning ambiguous. 
- In most situations, "that" is what you would naturally say and therefore what you should write.

#### Which
- If your sentence needs a comma to achieve its precise meaning, it probably needs "which."
- "Which" serves a particular identifying function.

A great example:
- (A) "Take the shoes that are in the closet" → This means: take the shoes that are in the closet, not the ones under the bed. 
- (B) "Take the shoes, which are in the closet" → Only one pair of shoes is under discussion; the "which" usage tells you where they are. 
→ Note that the comma is necessary in B, but not in A.

### CONCEPT NOUNS.

These sentences with concept nouns - "reaction," "cynicism," "response," "hostility." have no people in them and no working verbs — only "is" or "isn't". For example:
- The common reaction is incredulous laughter.
- Bemused cynicism isn't the only response to the old system.
- The current campus hostility is a symptom of the change.

→ Turn these cold sentences around by getting people doing things:
- Most people just laugh with disbelief.
- Some people respond to the old system by turning cynical; others say 
- It's easy to notice the change—you can see how angry all the students are.

### CREEPING NOUNISM.

This is a new American disease that strings two or three nouns together where one noun or, better yet, one verb will do:
- "We have money problem areas".
- "We have precipitation activity or a thunderstorm probability situation".
Or, as many as four or five concept nouns will attach themselves to each other:
- "Communication facilitation skills development intervention".

### OVERSTATEMENT.

- Don't overstate like this:
  - "The living room looked as if an atomic bomb had gone off there"
  - "I felt as if ten 747 jets were flying through my brain"
- Let the humor sneak up instead.

### CREDIBILITY.

- Don't inflate an incident to make it more outlandish than it actually was → If the reader catches you in just one bogus statement that you are trying to pass off as true, everything you write thereafter will be suspect.

### DICTATION.

Dictated sentences tend to be pompous, sloppy and redundant → Executives who are so busy should at least find time to edit what they have dictated, making sure that what they write is a true reflection of who they are.

### WRITING IS NOT A CONTEST.

Many writers are paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with everybody else who is trying to write and presumably doing it better:
- Can often happen in a writing class.
- Hobbles freelance writers, who see the work of other writers appearing in magazines while their own keeps returning in the mail.
→ Forget the competition and go at your own pace. Your only contest is with yourself.

### THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND.

Often you'll spend a whole day trying to fight your way out of some verbal thicket in which you seem to be tangled beyond salvation. Frequently a solution will occur to you the next morning when you plunge back in.
→ Stay alert to the currents around you because much of what you see and hear will come back, having percolated for days or months or even years, just when your conscious mind, laboring to write, needs it.

### THE QUICKEST FIX.

- Often a difficult problem in a sentence can be solved by simply getting rid of it.
- When you find yourself at such an impasse, look at the troublesome element and ask, "Do I need it at all?"

### PARAGRAPHS.

- Keep your paragraphs short → Short paragraphs put air around what you write and make it look inviting, whereas a long chunk of type can discourage a reader from even starting to read.
- But don't go berserk. A succession of tiny paragraphs is as annoying as a paragraph that's too long.
- Good nonfiction writers think in paragraph units, not in sentence units. Each paragraph has its own integrity of content and structure.

### SEXISM.

- Don't use constructions that suggest that only men can be settlers or farmers or cops or firefighters.
- A thornier problem is raised by the feminists' annoyance with words that contain "man," such as "chairman" and "spokesman." Their point is that women can chair a committee as well as a man and are equally good at spoking → One solution is to find another term: "chair" for "chairman," "company representative" for "spokesman." Can also convert the noun into a verb: "Speaking for the company, Ms. Jones said ..."
- Where a certain occupation has both a masculine and a feminine form, look for a generic substitute. For example: Actors and actresses can become performers.
- There is still the bothersome pronoun - "He" and "him" and "his" are words that rankle → The solutions can be:
  - Turn them into the plural: "All employees should decide what they think is best for them and their dependents." (good only in small doses)
  - Use "or": "Every employee should decide what he or she thinks is best for him or her." (should be used sparingly)
  - Eliminate "he" and its connotations of male ownership by using other pronouns or by altering some other component of the sentence:
    - "We" is a handy replacement for "he" "Our" and "the" can often replace "his": "First we notice what's happening to our kids and we blame it on the neighborhood".
    - One other pronoun is "you": "You'll often find ..."
- Always look for ways to make yourself available to the people you're trying to reach.

### REWRITING.

- Rewriting is the essence of writing well as most writers don't initially say what they want to say, or say it as well as they could.
- Clear writing is the result of a lot of tinkering.
- Writing is an evolving process, not a finished product.
- Most rewriting consists of reshaping and tightening and refining the raw material you wrote to make sure you've given the reader a narrative flow he can follow with no trouble from beginning to end.

Some common things to check for when rewriting that the writer might fail to keep the reader notified of:
- changes in time.
- place and mood.
- vary and animate the style.

A good example of the rewriting process:
1. Identifying issues and improvements:
```
There used to be a time when neighbors took care of one another, he remembered. [Put "he remembered" first to establish reflective tone.] It no longer seemed to happen that way, however. [The contrast supplied by "however" must come first. Start with "But." Also establish America locale.] He wondered if it was because everyone in the modern world was so busy. [All these sentences are the same length and have the same soporific rhythm; turn this one into a question?] It occurred to him that people today have so many things to do that they don't have time for old-fashioned friendship. [Sentence essentially repeats previous sentence; kill it or warm it up with specific detail.] Things didn't work that way in America in previous eras. [Reader is still in the present; reverse the sentence to tell him he's now in the past. "America" no longer needed if inserted earlier.] And he knew that the situation was very different in other countries, as he recalled from the years when he lived in villages in Spain and Italy. [Reader is still in America. Use a negative transition word to get him to Europe. Sentence is also too flabby. Break it into two sentences?] It almost seemed to him that as people got richer and built their houses farther apart they isolated themselves from the essentials of life. [Irony deferred too long. Plant irony early. Sharpen the paradox about richness.] And there was another thought that troubled him. [This is the real point of the paragraph; signal the reader that it's important. Avoid weak "there was" construction.] His friends had deserted him when he needed them most during his recent illness. [Reshape to end with "most"; the last word is the one that stays in the reader's ear and gives the sentence its punch. Hold sickness for next sentence; it's a separate thought.] It was almost as if they found him guilty of doing something shameful. [Introduce sickness here as the reason for the shame. Omit "guilty"; it's implicit.] He recalled reading somewhere about societies in primitive parts of the world in which sick people were shunned, though he had never heard of any such ritual in America. [Sentence starts slowly and stays sluggish and dull. Break it into shorter units. Snap off the ironic point.]
```

2. Perform the update:
```
He remembered that neighbors used to take care of one another. But that no longer seemed to happen in America. Was it because everyone was
so busy? Were people really so preoccupied with their television sets and their cars and their fitness programs that they had no time for friendship? In previous eras that was never true. Nor was it how families lived in other parts of the world. Even in the poorest villages of Spain and Italy, he recalled, people would drop in with a loaf of bread. An ironic idea struck him: as people got richer they cut themselves off from the richness of life. But what really troubled him was an even more shocking fact. The time when his friends deserted him was the time when he needed them most. By getting sick he almost seemed to have done something shameful. He knew that other societies had a custom of "shunning" people who were very ill. But that ritual only existed in primitive cultures. Or did it?
```

→ The rewriting is mainly about: altering the sequence, tightening the flow, sharpening the point. You can read your article aloud from beginning to end, always remembering where you left the reader in the previous sentence.

#### Tips
- Learn to enjoy this tidying process.
- Replace a humdrum word with one that has more precision or color.
- Strengthen the transition between one sentence and another.
- Rephrase a drab sentence to give it a more pleasing rhythm or a more graceful musical line.

### WRITING ON A COMPUTER.

- The computer is a technology's gift to rewriting and reorganizing that it puts your words right in front of your eyes for your instant consideration and reconsideration.
- With a computer compared to a typewriter, these are crucial gains for a writer: time, output, energy, enjoyment and control.

### TRUST YOUR MATERIAL.

- There's nothing more interesting than the truth.
- Don't annoy your readers by over-explaining—by telling them something they already know or can figure out. The reader plays a major role in the act of writing and must be given room to play it. 
- Try not to use words like "surprisingly," "predictably" and "of course," which put a value on a fact before the reader encounters the fact.

Many reporters had fallen into the habit of trying to make the news more palatable by writing in a feature style. Their leads consisted of a series of snippets that went something like this:
- Whoosh!
- It was incredible.
- And now there was also little Scooter to worry about. 
- Come to think of it, the dog was acting kind of suspicious.
→ The assumption is that fact and color are two separate ingredients. But they're not, color is organic to the fact. Your job is to present the colorful fact.

### GO WITH YOUR INTERESTS.

- There's no subject you don't have permission to write about.
- Follow your affections you will write well and will engage your readers regardless of the area of life.
- Write about your hobbies: cooking, gardening, photography, knitting, antiques, jogging, sailing, scuba diving, tropical birds, tropical fish.
- Write about your work: teaching, nursing, running a business, running a store.
- Write about a field you enjoyed in college and always meant to get back to: history, biography, art, archaeology.
