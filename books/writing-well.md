# Introduction

There's the miracle: All those people who said they hate writing and can't write and don't want to write __can__ write and __do want__ to write. In fact, they can't be turned off. Never have so many Americans written so profusely and with so few inhibitions. Which means that it wasn't a __cognitive__ problem after all. It was a __cultural__ problem, rooted in that old bugaboo of American education: __fear__.

→ Writing is talking to someone else on paper. Anybody who can think clearly can write clearly, about any subject at all.

- Good writers know that very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time. For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and reshaping—without the drudgery of retyping. 
- Bad writers became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen.

# Principles

## The Transaction

There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you.

Two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: __humanity__ and __warmth__.

Good writing keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next → Achieve the greatest clarity and strength.

## Simplicity

The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.

Here are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence:
- Word that serves no function.
- Long word that could be a short word.
- Adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb.
- Passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what.

Example of bad writing: The president of a university wrote a letter: "You are probably aware that we have been experiencing very considerable potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction on issues only partially related." → it simply meant that the students had been hassling them about different things.

The answer are: 
- Clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing.
- Try to make what has been written tighter, stronger and more precise, eliminating every element that's not doing useful work.
- Writers must constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves.
- Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time.

## Clutter

Fighting clutter is like fighting weeds — the writer is always slightly behind.

Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out of it that shouldn't be there. For example:
- "now" or "today" instead of "at this point in time".
- "up" in "free up" shouldn't be there.
- Take the adjective "personal," as in "a personal friend of mine," "his personal feeling" or "her personal physician." → that personal can be simply identified as "her physician."

Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word that means the same thing, or is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes.

"Experiencing" is one of the ultimate clutters. For example, "Are you experiencing any pain?" is far worst than "Does it hurt?".

Clutter is the language of the Pentagon calling an invasion a "reinforced protective reaction strike" and justifying its vast budgets on the need for "counter-force deterrence". Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.

Beware, then, of the long word that's no better than the short word: 
- "assistance" (help)
- "numerous" (many) 
- "facilitate" (ease)
- "individual" (man or woman)
- "remainder" (rest)
- "initial" (first)
- "implement" (do)
- "sufficient" (enough)
- "attempt" (try)
- "referred to as" (called)
- "with the possible exception of" (except)
- "due to the fact that" (because)
- "he totally lacked the ability to" (he couldn't)
- "until such time as" (until)
- "for the purpose of" (for).

Common examples of a piece of writing that isn't doing useful work:
- The unnecessary preposition appended to a verb ("order up")
- The adverb that carries the same meaning as the verb ("smile happily")
- The adjective that states a known fact ("tall skyscraper")
- The little qualifiers that weaken any sentence they inhabit ("a bit," "sort of") 
- The meaningless phrases ("in a sense,")
- An entire sentence that essentially repeats what the previous sentence said or says something readers don't need to know or can figure out for themselves

→ Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Simplify, simplify.

## Style

Simplicity carried to an extreme might seem to point to a style little more sophisticated than "Dick likes Jane" and "See Spot run".

The point is that you have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up with your style.

Style is organic to the person doing the writing, as much a part of him as his hair, or, if he is bald, his lack of it → Trying to add style is like adding a toupee. At first glance the formerly bald man looks young and even handsome. But at second glance, he doesn't look quite right.

It's amazing how often an editor can throw away the first three or four paragraphs of an article, or even the first few pages, and start with the paragraph where the writer begins to sound like himself or herself. 

The is-a-person-writing check is a sentence that says something like `"I'll never forget the day when I..."` → Writers are at their most natural when they write in the first person. 

There are vast regions of writing where "I" isn't allowed:
- Newspapers don't want "I" in their news stories.
- Many magazines don't want it in their articles.
- Businesses and institutions don't want it in the reports.
- Colleges don't want "I" in their term papers or dissertations.
- English teachers discourage any first-person pronoun except the literary "we".

Sensible reasons for avoiding "I":
- Newspaper articles should consist of news, reported objectively. 
- Teachers who don't want to give students an easy escape into opinion before they have grappled with the discipline of assessing a work on its merits and on external sources. For example: "I think Hamlet was stupid".

Takeaways:
- Must know what the essential tools are and what job they were designed to do.
- Never forget that you are practicing a craft that's based on certain principles.
- If what you build is sturdy and serviceable, take satisfaction in its plain strength.
- A fundamental rule is: be yourself → It requires writers to do two things that by their metabolism are impossible: relax and have confidence.
- To relax effectively, don't try so hard to make an impression, just plunge in.
- Write in the first person when possible: to use "I" and "me" and "we" and "us."
- If it is not allowed to use "I", at least think "I" while you write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the "I"s out → It will warm up your impersonal style.
- Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal.
- Believe in your own identity and your own opinions.
- Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.

## The Audience

"Who am I writing for?" - it s a fundamental question, and it has a fundamental answer: You are writing for yourself.

Donts: 
- Try to visualize the great mass audience → every reader is a different person.
- Try to guess what sort of thing editors want to publish or what you think the country is in a mood to read → they don't know what they want to read until they read it. Besides, they're always looking for something new.
- Worry about whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge a sudden impulse for humor → If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in.

You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.

There are 2 different issues:
- __Craft__, is a question of mastering a precise skill → reader is an impatient bird, perched on the thin edge of distraction or sleep.
- __Attitude__ is a question of how you use that skill to express your personality → write for yourself and not be gnawed by worry over whether the reader is tagging along.

How can you think carefully about not losing readers and still be carefree about their opinion?
- __Craft__:
  - Work hard to master the tools. 
  - Simplify, prune and strive for order.
  - Think of this as a mechanical act, and soon your sentences will become cleaner.

- __Attitude__:
  - Think of this as a creative act: the expressing of who you are.
  - Relax and say what you want to say.
  - Only need to be true to yourself when you write.
  - Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation. → If you're not a person who says "indeed" or "moreover," or who calls someone an individual ("he's a fine individual"), don't write it.

Mencken was never timid or evasive; tie didn't kowtow to the reader or curry anyone's favor. It takes courage to be such a writer, but it is out of such courage that revered and influential journalists are born.

Any writer who uses "ain't" and "tendentious" in the same sentence, who quotes without using quotation marks, knows what he's doing. This seemingly artless style, so full of art, is ideal for Herndon's purpose. It avoids the pretentiousness that infects so much writing by people who are doing worthy work, and it allows for a rich vein of humor and common sense. 

## Words

`Journalese` - a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech:
- Adjectives are used as nouns ("greats", "notables").
- Nouns are used as verbs ("to host"), or they are chopped off to form verbs ("enthuse", "emote"), or they are padded to form verbs ("beef up",  "put teeth into").

→ Its the death of freshness in anybody's style - the common currency of newspapers and of magazines, a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them.

Example of such journalese phrases that only reach the nearest cliché:
- "Shouldered his way" 
- "only to be met" 
- "crashing into his face" 
- "waging a lonely war" 
- "corruption that is rife" 
- "sending shock"
- "New York's finest"
→ We know just what to expect. No surprise awaits us in the form of an unusual word, an oblique look.

### Takeaway
- Develop a respect for words and a curiosity about their shades of meaning that is almost obsessive.
- Take the time to root around and find the ones you want.
- Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what has been written by earlier masters.
- Learn by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing that you wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.
- Get in the habit of using dictionaries.
- Learn about words' etymology and notice what curious branches they original root have put forth.
- Master the small gradations between words that seem to be synonyms. For instances:
  - "cajole", "wheedle", "blandish" and "coax".
  - Look up "villain", since only a lexicographer could conjure back of iniquity, obliquity, depravity, knavery, profligacy, frailty, flagrancy, infamy, immorality, corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding and sin.
  - Nouns: ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, Jezebels and jades.
  - Adjectives: foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical.
- Use dictionary with gratitude → you want to know how synonyms differ first, then go to the dictionary.
- Pay attentions to how words sound when choosing and stringing them together → readers hear what they are reading far more than you realize. For example, E. B. White suggests phrases that has survived for a century:
  - "Times like these try men's souls."
  - "How trying it is to live in these times!"
  - "These are trying times for men's souls."
  - "Soulwise, these are trying times."
- If all your sentences move at the same plodding gait, which even you recognize as deadly but don't know how to cure, read them aloud.
- See if you can gain wordings variety so they don't all sound as if they came out of the same mold by:
  - reversing the order of a sentence.
  - substituting a word that has freshness or oddity.
  - altering the length of your sentences.

## Usage

Good words:
- "Hassle" is both a verb and a noun, meaning to give somebody a hard time, or the act of being given a hard time.
- "Freak" means an enthusiast, and there's no missing the aura of obsession that goes with calling someone a jazz freak, or a chess freak, or a sun freak.

Cheap words:
- "notables" 
- "greats" 
- "upcoming"

Why is one word good and another word cheap? 
→ No concrete answer because:
- sage has no fixed boundaries.
- Language is a fabric that changes from one week to another.
- Word freaks fight over what is allowable, often reaching their decision on a subjective basis such as `taste`.

`The American Heritage Dictionary` - it assembled a "Usage Panel" to help them appraise the new words and dubious constructions that had come knocking at the door.

The laws of usage are relative, bending with the taste of the lawmaker → In the end, it comes down to what is "correct" usage. For example:
- "dropout" - the perfect word.
- "cyberspace," "meltdown," "skyjacker," "wetlands," "software," "fax," "macho," "yuppie," "gentrify" - correct usage every day of science and technology, fad and fashion and social change.
- "trip," "rap," "crash," "trash," "funky," "split," "rip-off," "vibes," "downer," "bummer" - lashing back at the self-important verbiage.
- "can" and "may," "fewer" and "less," "eldest" and "oldest," etc. - most of the classic distinctions in grammar.

Incorrect usage will lose you the readers you would most like to win. Know the difference between:
- a "reference" and an "allusion" 
- "connive" and "conspire" 
- "compare with" and "compare to"
- If you must use "comprise", use it right. It means "include" - `dinner comprises meat, potatoes, salad and dessert`.

One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon. For example:
- "prioritize" is jargon - a pompous new verb that sounds more important than "rank" — and that "bottom line" is usage, a metaphor borrowed from the world of bookkeeping that conveys an image we can picture. As every businessman knows, the bottom line is the one that matters. If someone says, "The bottom line is that we just can't work together," we know what he means. I don't much like the phrase, but the bottom line is that it's here to stay.

New usages also arrive with new political events. For example:
- Vietnam gave us "escalate".
- Watergate gave us a whole lexicon of words connoting obstruction and deceit: "stonewall," "deep-six," "launder," "enemies list" and other "gate"-suffix scandals ("Irangate").
→ It's vivid, and we need it.

A similar guideline for separating good from technical English. For example, the difference between, "printout" and "input":
- A printout is a specific object that a computer emits. Before the advent of computers it wasn't needed; now it is. But it has stayed where it belongs. 
- Not so with "input," which was coined to describe the information that's fed to a computer. Our input is sought on every subject, from diets to philosophical discourse ("I'd like your input on whether God really exists").
→ Good usage consists of using good words if they already exist to express myself clearly and simply to someone else.
