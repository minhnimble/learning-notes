# Learning Notes

This repository is for containing the notes on the books that I read and the codebases that I studied. By having these short summaries, I can recall them right afterward and it helps me a lot in my learning process. Here you'll find some of those little pieces.

### Books

* [Personal Kanban: Mapping Work, Navigating Life](books/personal-kanban.md) by **Jim Benson** and **Tonianne DeMaria Barry**, 2011.
* [The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts in Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact](books/effective-engineer.md) by **Edmond Lau**, 2015.
