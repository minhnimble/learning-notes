# Learning Notes

This repository is for containing notes on books I read – recalling them right afterward by creating short summaries – helps a lot in my learning process. Here you'll find some of those little pieces.

### Books

* [Personal Kanban: Mapping Work, Navigating Life](books/personal-kanban.md) by **Jim Benson** and **Tonianne DeMaria Barry**, 2011.
